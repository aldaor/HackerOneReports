Summary:

Hi Team,

**Summary:**

I have found an Insufficient Session Expiration on implementation of the new `Revoke user session` feature of HackerOne here: https://hackerone.com/settings/sessions

**Description:**

The new __REVOKE__ session feature will destroy the session of the selected device, that means any request that requires authorization should not work (`POST`, `GET`) __BUT__ i have observed that you forgot the `GraphQL` query request, i can still query sensitive information despite i already revoke my current session and this can result a __sensitive information disclosure__  

### Steps To Reproduce

  1. Login to hackerone.com
  2. Go to sensitive page and capture the `GraphQL` request , on my case i captured the bounty settings `{"query":"query User_bounty_settings_page... etc` on this end point: https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties
  3. Send the GraphQL request to repeater
  4. Go to https://hackerone.com/settings/sessions and click `Revoke` to destroy the current session
  5. You will be logout to your account, means session destroyed
  6. Go back to burp repeater and click `Go` to repeat the graphql request
  7. Observed that you can still query the graphql `User_bounty_settings_page`, and it will disclosed the reports that was rewarded, including the amounts, report title, payment method used and other sensitive information.

__Below is my sample GraphQL query and response after revoking the session:__

```

## Impact

Insufficient Session Expiration can result to sensitive information disclosure.

Let me know if anything else is needed.
