Summary:

Description:
The mobile application uses a predictable Random Number Generator (RNG).
Under certain conditions this weakness may jeopardize mobile application data encryption or other protection based on randomization. For example, if encryption tokens are generated inside of the application and an attacker can provide application with a predictable token to validate and then execute a sensitive activity within the application or its backend.

Example of insecure code:
Random random = new Random();
byte bytes[] = new byte[20];
random.nextBytes(bytes);

Example of secure code:
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte bytes[] = new byte[20];
random.nextBytes(bytes);

## Impact

When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.

Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.
