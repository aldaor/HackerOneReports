Summary:

Hi,

Anyone can add themselves as an administrator on the readme.io uber project that powers developer.uber.com/documentation

To replicate this, first fetch https://uber.readme.io/inactiveand and grab Uber's project ID from the source: 578cd33dc27ce20e004e397b

Then, using this ID, create a normal account on readme.io, verify the email address, log in, and send the following HTTP request:

POST /api/accept-invite/5617f98f7f74330d00dfd86d HTTP/1.1
Host: dash.readme.io
Connection: close
Content-Length: 2
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36

The server will respond with "Invite doesn't exist". However, if you go to dash.readme.io you will find that you can now access uber as an administrator. After logging in, I went straight to the users page, took a screenshot as evidence (attached) and removed myself as an administrator. 

Administrators are able to inject arbitrary JavaScript into documentation pages by design, so this could be used for a stored XSS attack on developer.uber.com to hijack developer accounts.
