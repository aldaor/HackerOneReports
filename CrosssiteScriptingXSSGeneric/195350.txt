Summary:

I noticed `slack-core.com` is used for Slack's call infrastructure. I had never seen that domain before, so I decided to find out what else was running on it. It turned out `podcasts.slack-core.com` was pointing to a Podcast and RSS hosting service called Feed.Press. However, there was no Feed.Press account associated with `podcasts.slack-core.com`, which allowed me to register it and start serving my content from this domain. 

Note that since it is not on Slack's root domain, the impact of this vulnerability seems pretty minimal.

# Proof of Concept
Here we can see `podcasts.slack-core.com` is CNAME'd to `redirect.feedpress.me`:

```plain
michiel@msp ~ $ dig podcasts.slack-core.com                                                                                         [2.1.9]

```

By creating my own account on [Feed.Press](https://feed.press), I was able to register `podcasts.slack-core.com` as my "custom domain" under my Feed.Press account. After it propagated through Feed.Press' systems, I was able to fully control the contents served as http://podcasts.slack-core.com.

Since the domain was dormant, I decided to redirect `/` to https://hackerone.com as a proof of concept. We can see that happening using this `curl` command (note the `Location` header):

```plain
michiel@msp ~ $ curl -vv http://podcasts.slack-core.com
* Rebuilt URL to: http://podcasts.slack-core.com/
*   Trying 5.135.16.40...

```

# Remediation
Since the domain is not used anymore, it is recommended to remove the CNAME of `podcasts.slack-core.com` to `redirect.feedpress.me`. 

If you need me to release the domain in Feed.Press itself, let me know and I'll remove it from my account.
