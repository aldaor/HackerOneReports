Reporter:https://hackerone.com/mrunal

DateOfDisclosure:10.12.2018 17:34:25

Summary:

The page includes one or more script files from a third-party domain.

XSSI is a fancy way of saying: you are including in your program, someone elses code; You don't have any control over what is in that code, and you don't have any control over the security of the server on which it is hosted.
 
parameter : //secure.gaug.es/track.js
evidence: <script type="text/javascript" async defer id="gauges-tracker" data-site-id="4eab0ac8613f5d1583000005" src="//secure.gaug.es/track.js"></script>

solution : Ensure JavaScript source files are loaded from only trusted sources, and the sources can't be controlled by end users of the application.

## Impact

Browsers prevent pages of one domain from reading pages in other domains. But they do not prevent pages of a domain from referencing resources in other domains. In particular, they allow images to be rendered from other domains and scripts to be executed from other domains. An included script doesn't have its own security context. It runs in the security context of the page that included it. For example, if www.evil.example.com includes a script hosted on www.google.com then that script runs in the evil context not in the google context. So any user data in that script will "leak
