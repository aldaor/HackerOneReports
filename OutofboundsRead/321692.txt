Summary:

I would like to report an uninitialized Buffer allocation issue in `base64-url`.
It allows to extract sensitive data from uninitialized memory or to cause a DoS by passing in a large number, in setups where typed user input can be passed (e.g. from JSON).

# Module

**module name:** `base64-url`
**version:** 1.3.3
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/base64-url`

## Module Description

> Base64 encode, decode, escape and unescape for URL applications.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

The problem arises when a number is passed in, e.g. from user-submitted JSON-encoded data.
The API should not propagate the already-bad Buffer issue further.

On Node.js 6.x and below, this exposes uninitialized memory, which could contain sensitive data.

This can be also used to cause a DoS on any Node.js version by consuming the memory when large numbers are passed on input.

## Steps To Reproduce:

`console.log(require('base64-url').encode(1000))` (Node.js 6.x and lower — note uninitialized memory in output)

`require('base64-url').encode(1e8)` (any Node.js verision — note memory usage and time)

## Supporting Material/References:

- OS: Arch Linux current
- Node.js 6.13.0
- Node.js 9.5.0

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: Y
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

I contacted the author on 2017-03-02.
I did not receive a reply, but on 2017-08-17 a semver-major version 2.0.0 was released with a fix.

I want a CVE assigned to this issue, also I would prefer the fix to be backported to 1.x branch — a lot of modules still depend 1.x as of 2018-02-26.

Top-10 apps `@latest` versions of which install affected `base64-url@1` through their deps chains:
```
664945  react-native
346288  metro-bundler
83764   hubot
81089   sails
51724   phonegap
45522   csrf-tokens
28326   hubot-mock-adapter
25778   mock-hubot
23712   connect-phonegap
18808   nodedata
```

In total, there are about 2460 such apps in the npm registry, to my knowledge.

## Impact

Sensitive uninitialized memory exposure on Node.js 6.x or lower
Denail of Service on any Node.js version
