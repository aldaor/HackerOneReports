Summary:

Introduction
============

Passing primitive non-`Fixnum` values to the `values_at` method of `Struct` and `Range` leads to a segfault in both mruby and mruby-engine/parent Ruby process.

Proof of concept
================

list-crash.rb
-------------

    [].values_at true

struct-crash.rb
---------------

    Struct.new.new.values_at true

1. Save either of the above as `crash.rb`.
2. Run either:
   a) `mruby crash.rb`
   b) `sandbox crash.rb`
3. Both cause a segfault due to an invalid pointer dereference.

Discussion
==========

The crash is introduced in commit `79a621dd739faf4cc0958e11d6a887331cf79e48`.

The underlying cause is that the new `mrb_range_ptr` attempts to dereference a pointer derived from a `mrb_value` to check whether the `edges` member is `NULL` without ensuring that the `mrb_value` in question is a non-primitive (and therefore has a valid pointer value). In the case of the `values_at` methods, its arguments are passed to `mrb_get_values_at` which in turn passes it to `range_beg_len`. There it is passed to `mrb_range_ptr` before checking its type.

Solution
========

To fix the crash, the type of the value passed to `range_beg_len` should be checked before calling `mrb_range_ptr`. We've also looked through the codebase for other problematic instances, but found none.
