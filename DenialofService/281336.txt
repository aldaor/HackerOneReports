# Proof of concept

The attached file loop.gem causes an infinite loop in any command that tries to iterate over the entries in the tar container.
```
gem install loop.gem
gem unpack loop.gem
gem specification loop.gem
```

# Summary

[`Gem::Package::TarHeader.from`](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/v2.6.14/lib/rubygems/package/tar_header.rb#L97-L124) uses [`oct`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-oct) to parse fields in the tar header. `oct` does more than just parse octal digits, for example it permits these unexpected syntaxes:
- sign characters:
  - `"+012345".oct # 5349`
  - `"-012345".oct # -5349`
- radix prefixes:
  - `"0x12abc".oct # 76476`
  - `"0b10000".oct # 16`
- silently ignoring errors:
  - `"123,456".oct # 83`
  - `"nothing".oct # 0`

The ability to encode negative values enables a DoS (infinite loop) in the tar reader. The proof-of-concept loop.gem has a size field of `-0000001000\x00`, or −512. The negative size causes [`Gem::Package::TarReader.each`](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/v2.6.14/lib/rubygems/package/tar_reader.rb#L52) to seek *backwards* after reading the header, so it reads the same header over and over.

I suppose one could cause a lot of CPU usage on the rubygems.org server by uploading copies of loop.gem, but I didn't try it.

# Remediation

Instead of doing the conversion using `oct`, there could be a special-purpose function that validates its input better. It might be enough to check that the string matches `/\A[0-7]+\z/` before calling `oct`.

The attached patch file adds a test that `Gem::Package::TarHeader.from` rejects various bogus syntax.
