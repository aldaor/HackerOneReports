Summary:

whisper.sh fails to protect the invite form from abuse from attackers. If a malicious individual wants to abuse this functionality, they could send repeated/automated requests to the same phone number or range of phone numbers that do no actually belong to himself. This would result in lots of arbitrary SMS messages to a single user or large range of multiple users just by launching automated POST requests to wispher.sh.

To help prevent automated attacks, the form should utilize some form of captcha system that requires user knowledge in order to send repeat attempts and should block repeat requests to the same number multiple times.
