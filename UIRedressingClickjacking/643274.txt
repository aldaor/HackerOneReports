Summary:

**Summary:** [Viral Direct Message Clickjacking via link truncation leading to capture of both Google credentials & installation of malicious 3rd party Twitter App]

**Description:** [Because very long links in direct messages are truncated after 38 characters the malicious actors were able to provide a malicious link in a direct message that appeared as though it was to an authenticated YouTube video and caused a clickjacking scenario to occur. The link caused any users that were already logged into a Google account to be first logged out and then asked to log back in. A malicious Google app captured the account credentials and then redirected the user to the website getmorefollowers.biz (embedded in the initial link query string) which in turn redirected the user to freefollowers.eu domain. This executed a PHP script and /or a javascript which in turn redirected the user to one of at least 10 different randomized malicious 3rd party Twitter apps (see attached file redirect-sequence-from-start.png for the initial redirect sequence). Depending on whether the user was already logged into their Twitter account, the authentication process was potentially done for the user and/or the user only needed to click on the authenticate button. These apps all did essentially the same thing. They generated a couple of followers to the account but also hijacked the account into sending this same malicious link as a Direct message to everyone that it was able to in that account (open DMs and reciprocal follows). Thus creating the virality of the infection and starting the sequence all over again on hundreds of new victims.

Users that weren't already logged into Google were redirected directly to getmorefollowers.biz and then to freefollowers.eu and then to the malicious Twitter app and sent to one of at least 10 different randomized Oauth screens and encouraged to connect to a 3rd party Twitter app that would supposedly provide you free followers (also provided a paid service to increase your followers).

Here is an example "FULL" link we received from a malicious account that we were investigating named @█████████

What gets displaying and hotlinked in the Direct Message is this:

ONLY FOR YOU Eric JN Ellason { accounts.youtube.com/accounts/SetSI... } message id: 92439

Screenshot attachment (new-DM-infections.png) shows 9 new links sent out as DMs to new victims from another infected account we posted to Twitter.


Here is an older example that we found:

## Steps To Reproduce:

(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

 1. [Direct message is sent from a reciprocal follow within your account. Presumably can happen to accounts with Open DMs. The direct message, because of link truncation appears to be a Youtube video. Message in general looks like this.  ONLY FOR YOU Eric JN Ellason { accounts.youtube.com/accounts/SetSI... } message id: 92439 ]
 2. [The User who receives this direct message from someone they follow, clicks on the embedded link (in some cases from very trusted sources who have themselves been infected).]
 3. [The link sequence first attempts to log the user out of any Google accounts or apps they are currently logged into. And then asks them to relog back into their Google account, capturing their Google account credentials. Presumably there is a malicious Google app that they have created which in turn continues the sequence and currently eventually sends them to the website www.getmorefollowers.biz . Other domains have been used and will likely be swapped out in the future. We provide a list of 7 domains we believe have been used in this campaign.]
 4. [getmorefollowers.biz currently redirects the user to www.freefollower.eu and specifically this URL www.freefollower.eu/redirect.php. The user will generally be unaware of this redirect and will only see the final Twitter authentication screen to authenticate a 3rd party Twitter app. We were able to short circuit the redirect chain and use just the URL www.freefollower.eu/redirect.php from different VPN locations and with a virgin state browser to identify most of the different malicious 3rd party apps. It appears they randomize sending the user to 1 of at least 10 different 3rd party apps. We document them below in the "Additional Materials" section]
 5. [For users not logged into any Google accounts, they get directly sent to the website www.getmorefollowers.biz and step 4 above continues the sequence ]
 6. [Since the user is presumably already logged into their Twitter account they then get an authentication screen asking them to authenticate the app. It is also possible via malicious javascripts that this process of clicking on the authentication button is completed for them in the background making the user completely unaware of much of this sequence.]
 7. [If the user is not logged into their Twitter account and has javascript disabled I believe the sequence does stop at the freefollower.eu website. Here you can click on the "Signin with Twitter" button to log into your Twitter account and then authenticate this app to have access to your account. Of course this sequence really only happens with security professionals looking into and short circuiting the redirect sequences]

## Impact: [The attacker in this situation has already been able to create a viral attack vector in addition to harvesting thousands of Google account credentials and installing their malicious 3rd party Twitter app on thousands of accounts. Please note this report is also being submitted to the Google Bug Bounty program because part of the attack sequence occurs on their infrastructure.

Once one account is breached that account in turn sends out the malicious link via the authenticated 3rd party Twitter app (we identify the set of randomized apps above) to everyone in their trusted set of reciprocal follows (since the link is sent only via direct message). This greatly increases the trust factor and likely hood a significant number of people that receive this link will click and follow the malicious sequence and continue the viral infection sequence. At the same time the hackers can have their malicious 3rd party Twitter app authenticated within thousands of accounts. Through RiskIQ we were already able to verify that thousands of Twitter accounts within the past month had been breached and infected via this Clickjacking attack. We are attaching a document showing about 1000 accounts that fell victim to this attack (see attachment ███). We have confirmed a handful on this list by finding tweets much like the account reDawn8718 that we have attached here.

We also plan to publish our findings once we are contacted and the issue is resolved in a timely manner.]

## Supporting Material/References:

  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)
  
Web domains used or previously used by these malicious actors.
getmorefollowers.biz
freefollower.eu
www.freeaddme.us
followplanet.us
forfollow.net
followback.us
bestfollowers.in

This domain (pisagor.xyz) was hidden in the sequence and appears to run some kind of a javascript based redirect

Much of this malicious infrastructure is hosted on a Turkish host called "Radore Veri Merkezi Hizmetleri" at the IP address 213.128.89.35. In some examples we found that the Google redirect used the Turkish version of Google (www.google.com.tr).

Here is the list of different Oauth links that were generated from the malicious link that we tested from multiple VPN locations and browser setups. There did not appear to be any victim fingerprinting that we could identify. Rather it appeared to just randomly select 1 of at least 10 different malicious 3rd party app authentications.
