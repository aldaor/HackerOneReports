Summary:

bypass X-Frame-Options ( Proxy protection NOT used )

DomainUsing: gratipay.com

Proxy protection NOT used , i can bypass X-Frame-Options header and recreate clickjacking on the whole domain.
I see that you don't have a reverse proxy protection this allows all users to proxy your website rather than iframe it. They use use it for

    Phishing
    Tricking First-time gratipay users that (fake website) is original website.
    Debug gratipay.com (see all request an response make on fake website)

Exploit

I will create a fake website which closely matches your domain or any other confusing domain.
I will post on many forums that "gratipay.com is best" etc. with my fake website link (better to use URl shortner!)
He will visit here and signup
As I have made that proxy, I can see all request made on them thus , Passwords Also!
I will hack him.
NOTE: When he clicks on confirmation link in his email , He is redirected to ORIGNAL website but I will get his password and username and I would login with the username and password i have , on original website.

FIX

Here is the code that I use for stopping 100% of these types of sites:


RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:VIA} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:FORWARDED} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:USERAGENT_VIA} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X_FORWARDED_FOR} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:PROXY_CONNECTION} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:XPROXY_CONNECTION} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:HTTP_PC_REMOTE_ADDR} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:HTTP_CLIENT_IP} !^$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F]

To use this code, copy & paste into your site's root .htaccess file. Upload to your server, and test its effectiveness ! It is perfect and compared to blacklisting a million sites of this kind, itâs lightweight, concise, and very effective.

Please let me know if want more information.
