Summary:

**Summary:**

There is an Open Redirect on  https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/exit.php?url= due to the application not checking the value passed by the user to the "url" parameter.

**Description:**

Unchecked redirects occur when an application redirects to a destination controlled by attackers. This often occurs in functionality returning users to a previous page, e.g. after authenticating.

An attacker can control the value of the "url" parameter and make it redirect to a malicious endpoint.

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/exit.php?url=

## Steps To Reproduce:

Here is a proof of concept to demonstrate how an open redirect occurs. Please note that this particular example is not a vulnerability and just here for demonstration purposes.

PoC: https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/exit.php?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5mb3NlYy5jb20uYnI=

The URL looks like it should go to https://blog.fuzzing-project.org, but you are redirected to https://www.infosec.com.br

## Supporting Material/References:

Mitigation:

When possible, do not allow user input to directly control redirect destinations; rather, generate them on the server side (e.g. via ID -> URL mapping). When this is not an option, a strict whitelist is highly recommended. Finally, a last-ditch mitigation can be performed by removing protocol specifiers from user input prior to redirection. This last method will not fix intra-site redirect exploits, but can prevent redirects to an attacker-controlled website.

## Impact

Attackers may be able to use this to execute believable phishing attacks, bypass authentication, or (in rare circumstances) violate CSRF mitigations.
