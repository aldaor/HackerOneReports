Summary:

I would like to report a Service Side JavaScript Code Injection in `fastify`.
It allows an attacker that can control a single property name in the serialization schema to achieve Remote Command Execution in the context of the web server.

# Module

**module name:** fastify
**version:** 2.2.0
