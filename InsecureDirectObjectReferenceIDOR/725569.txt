## Summary:
Hi team
Hope you are good
Missing proper authorization checks on the vulnerable request allows an attacker to approve/decline afk of users on the behalf of other user who is a member of other organization. This can be exploited simply by changing the responder_user_id in the vulnerable request.

## Platform(s) Affected:
[Happy tools / Website]

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create two accounts for happy tools and login into two different browsers say accounts 1 and 2 and browser A and B.
2. Configure browser A with burp proxy
3. Put an AFK request.
4. Go to https://schedule.happy.tools/afk and click on approve or decline and capture the request in burp.
5. Now replace the value of `responder_user_id` with the user id of account 2.
6. Valid response is shown.

## Supporting Material/References:

In this screenshot, the `user_id: 1920` is the id of user who belongs to account 1 and the `responder_user_id:1923` is the id of user B who belongs to different account and both users belong to different organizations.
