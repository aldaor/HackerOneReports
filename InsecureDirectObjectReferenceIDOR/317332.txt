Summary:

**Summary:** User without permissions to add a Register to an Outlet can bypass this restriction and add a Register to an Outlet.

**Description:** I do not know which permission exactly controls this action, I tested this against default `Cashier` role. User with default `Cashier` role has no permission to add registers.  If a user creates his own store on `vendhq.com` then he can add a Register to an Outlet.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Add a user to store A with `Cashier` role. Assume the added user's email is attacker@attacker.com
  2. Go to `Setup` -> `Outlets and Registers`
  3. Create an outlet in store A
  4. Create a new store B using email attacker@attacker.com
  5. Log in to store B with attacker@attacker.com credentials
  6. Create an outlet in store B
  7. Run Burp Suite or any other proxy to intercept requests
  8. Add a register to outlet in store B and intercept outgoing POST request
  9. Replace id in `vend_register%5Boutlet_id%5D=<outlet id>` from the request with id of outlet from store A and process the request
  10. Check outlet from store A - a register should be added to it

```

Cashier can get id of interesting outlet from `Sales Ledger` page source.

## Impact

An attacker can add registers to outlets even if he has no permissions to do it.
