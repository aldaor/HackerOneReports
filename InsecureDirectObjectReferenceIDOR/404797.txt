Summary:

**Summary:** The parameter `photo_ids` in below request is vulnerable to IDOR

/php/client_manage_handler?██████████&case=remove-active-photo

**Description:** Since there is no check for res_id or ownership I was able to delete Gerben's image by just using the photo_id from his store. This is a problem because it is a get request and I can try a bunch of ID's to randomly delete photos that don't belong to me or try to find a way to leak this ID from store page to do targeted deletes. 

I believe if you try to delete multiple photos there will be more ids in the request so that would allow to expand the attack by trying a lot of ids at once.

**Platform(s) Affected:** [website]


## Steps To Reproduce:


  1. Get 2 stores.
  2. With store 1 navigate to https://www.zomato.com/clients/manage_photos.php
  3. Start to delete a photo and capture the request that looks like :

```
GET /php/client_manage_handler?███&case=remove-active-photo HTTP/1.1

```

4 . Save the photo_ids parameter
5 . Go to your second restaurant account and capture the same request with a different res_id and cookies
6 . Replace the `photo_ids` with the id from step 4 and send request.
7 . Observe the photo is deleted.

## Impact

By using targeted or blind attacks it is possible to delete photos that don't belong to a restaurant because of this IDOR. My leading theory is that currently you are checking that the logged in user has permissions on the res_id in the request but not verifying that the res_id owns that photograph. There should be an additional check to ensure that the photo_id belongs to that restaurant before deleting it.
