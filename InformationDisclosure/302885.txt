Summary:

Hello Hackerone Security Team,

Well,we are aware of Imagemagick Gif parsor method to collect the pixels and then we can recover it to gain server information.

https://github.com/neex/gifoeb

However,it has no impact on hackerone since it's immune to gif files uploading functionality.
So, ,gif exploit will not work at all using this method.

Today,I Bypassed that method and modified new files and well, server disclose the many information.

Hackerone profile picture uploading functionality supports .gif, .png, .bmp, ,.tiff and .tif.


Step to reproduce:-

1)Creating exploitable files

In the terminal, as we have to run
./gifoeb gen 512x512 dump.gif  in order to create exploitable dump.gif file where 512x512 is pixel dimension and dump.gif is an gif file.

In order to bypass, You can modify the commands like this
E.g

a)    ./gifoeb gen 1123x987 dump.jpg
b)    ./gifoeb gen 1123x987 dump.png
c)    ./gifoeb gen 1123x987 dump.bmp
d)   ./gifoeb gen 1123x987 dump.tiff
e)    ./gifoeb gen 1123x987 dump.tif

It will create the dump files with different extensions.
(Note: you can change the pixel dimension and file extension)

2) After creation of exploitable files, just upload in the profile settings. using modified Image files.

3) Server will return different pixel files.

4) Save and  recover the pixel files.

In my case, I uploaded dump files with different extensions and after recovery, server disclose the linux version As well as Server path directory.

This exploit was successful since whenever We upload the files,if we try to save an image, the webpage will automatically give .gif extension to save profile pictures.
