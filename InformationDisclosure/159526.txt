Hello team,
I noticed an issue in `Directory` where information of a soft-launched program getting disclosed!

I made this request as an unauthecated user,

I've attached the policy as text.

You won't see the bug count, policy and base bounty on result. but if you capture the request on BURP response, you'll be able to harvest these information from there!
