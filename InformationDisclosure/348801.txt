I have found a little information disclosure on your system.

Banner Grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a remote server. Additionally, this technique is use to get information about remote servers.

This information might help an attacker gain a greater understanding of the systems in use and potentially develop further attacks targeted at the specific version of Apache.

Remediation
Configure your web server to prevent information leakage from the SERVER header of its HTTP response.
