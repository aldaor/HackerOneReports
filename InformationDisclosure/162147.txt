# Vulnerability details
In anticipation of today's release, I took a look at the new boards feature - which, unrelated to this report, is awesome! There turns out to be an IDOR vulnerability when creating a list based on a label. An attacker can create a list with a label ID that belongs to a private repository. This leaks the name and description of the label to the attacker.

# Proof of concept
- Create a new, private repository
- In the created repository, create a new label - lets assume it has label ID 1
- Create another repository, doesn't matter if it's a private or public repository, and doesn't have to be scoped under the same namespace
- In the created repository, create another new label - lets assume it has label ID 2
- Go to the board of the repository created in step 3, and intercept your network traffic
- Click the label created and notice similar to the one below being sent to the GitLab instance:

**Request**
```
POST /jobertabma/test/board/lists HTTP/1.1
Host: gitlab-instance
...

{"list":{"label_id":2}}
```

**Response**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

{"id":3,"list_type":"label","position":1,"title":"super secret title","label":{"id":1,"title":"super secret title","color":"#428BCA","description":null,"priority":null}}
```

 - In the request, change the `label_id` to 1, or any other label ID that doesn't belong to you and forward the request.
 - Refresh the board page, notice the created list - it contains the label name and description

# Fix
This is a very ugly solution, but I just wanted to include it to point you to the vulnerability LoC. Line 18 (or 20, after the fix), creates a `List` object without making sure the provided `label_id` belongs to the project.
