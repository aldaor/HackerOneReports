-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Advisory ID: SYSS-2015-062
Product: ownCloud
Manufacturer: ownCloud Inc., Community
Affected Version(s): ownCloud <= 8.2.1, <= 8.1.4, <= 8.0.9
Tested Version(s): 8.1.1, 8.1.4
Vulnerability Type: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing (CWE-548)
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2015-07-17
Solution Date: 2015-12-23
Public Disclosure: 2016-01-05
CVE Reference: CVE-2016-1499
Author of Advisory: Dr. Erlijn van Genuchten (SySS GmbH)


Overview:
========

ownCloud is a software suite for creating and using file hosting
services.

The ownCloud Web site describes the software  as follows (see [1]):

"ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access 
to your data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while 
providing a platform to view, sync and share across devices easily — all 
under your control. ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a 
simple but powerful API for applications and plugins and it works with 
any storage."


Vulnerability Details:
=================

ownCloud is vulnerable to information exposure through directory
listing. It is possible with a normal user to get information about
the complete directory structure and included files of all users.
The 'force' parameter in the script (index.php/apps/files/ajax/scan.php)
can easily be manipulated, by setting its value to 'true'.

This vulnerability can potentially be used for denial-of-service attacks
if the selected directory is deep enough, because to index many
directories requires high computational effort. In addition, sensitive
information from other users is exposed.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
====================

With the following HTTP GET request, it is possible to see the
directories of other users.

```
GET /index.php/apps/files/ajax/scan.php?force=true&dir=&requesttoken=<VALIDREQUESTTOKEN> HTTP/1.1
Host: [HOST]
Accept: text/event-stream
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: [REFERER]

Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache

```
