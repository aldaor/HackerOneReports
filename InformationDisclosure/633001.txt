### Summary
When you use the REST API or UI to view an issue's discussion/notes, private system note is hidden to member's only.

Such as moving an issue to a private project, making issue as duplicate of a confidential issue, someone mentioned this issue in a confidential issue.

They are properly hidden in REST and UI, but you can still see them in graphql

### Steps to reproduce
- Open a new private browser without an authenticated session
- visit https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer
- paste this query and see the difference between UI https://gitlab.com/username16/ci-test/issues/1 <-- this is public project with public issue doing some private stuff and graphql response

```
query {
  project(fullPath:"username16/ci-test"){
    issue(iid:"1"){
      descriptionHtml

      notes{
        edges{
          node{
            bodyHtml
            system
            author{
              username
            }
            body
          }
        }
      }
    }}
  }
```

- You should notice it has moved to dynamic#1, which is not visible from UI
- also you should be able to see it was marked as duplicate of #2, which is not visible from UI cause #2 is confidential
- also you can see someone mentioned this issue in #2, which is not visible from UI cause #2 is confidentail
