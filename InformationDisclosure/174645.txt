**Description**

Suppose there are 2 `Folders` in the site

`Test1`
`Test2`

but a member has only `Admin` permission to `Test1` , he cant see the folder `Test2`

However, it is possible to know if such `folder/path` (Test2) exist in a site by guessing the names of the folder.


**Steps**

1.There are 2 `folders` in a site namely `Test1` and `Test2`
2. Member has full `Admin` permission to `Test1` and no permission at all to `Test2`. Member wont be able to see the folder `Test2` in his account at all.
3. Now member selects any file from `Test1` using checkbox and select move option from dropdown. he gets only path to `Test1` folders. 
4. now if i type some random names of the folders in the box and say move, it will throw the error. but if type the valid names of folders which may be in a site, it will say can not write. 
5. this proves that, if you can guess correct name of folder/path, it tells you the existence of the path.

**Resolution**
The response should be same for both requests. folder exist or not, it should throw 404!
