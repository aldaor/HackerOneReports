Summary:

##Description
Hi. I just noticed, that you are extended the scope for the bounty program. I looked to the first resource - 
```
https://federation.data.gov/
```
I noticed, that the `x-amz-meta-s3cmd-attrs` response header returns sensitive information, like system username:
```
x-amz-meta-s3cmd-attrs:uid:0/gname:root/uname:root/gid:0/mode:33188/mtime:1482273904/atime:1482273904/md5:c9d60fd5a46044f7c58684a6c701ce54/ctime:1482273904
```
{F215241}

##Impact
The attacker can gain sensitive information about system username. In this case it was `root`, so i marked impact as `Low`. Still, the developers can have a good reason to not expose this information in the response header.

##Suggested fix
I found the related article, written by other researcher:
https://medium.com/@arbazhussain/username-disclose-at-s3-balsamiq-d98336d4012d
and issue in the s3cmd repository: https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/issues/67
where sugested fix is adding the `-- no-preserve` comand.
