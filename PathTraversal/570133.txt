Summary:

I would like to report Path Traversal in http-file-server. It allows to list any files and sub folders in another folder of web root.

# Module

**module name:** http-file-server
**version:** 0.2.6
**npm page:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-file-server

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

http-file-server is simply get the path name of url and add it to the web root. it means if you input ../, it will happy add it to web root and you can list the folder you choose. But the trick is web browser or curl are also to try rebuild the url containing ../. I used the burp to make a raw url and send it to server.

## Steps To Reproduce:

install `http-file-server`
`$ npm install -g http-file-server`

start program: go to the folder of the module and run the file
`$ ./http-file-server.js --path=/tmp/ --host=* --port=1234`

start burpsuite and enter the url contain ../. you should see the files in the folder.
