# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

`superstatic` verifies that current dir is not evaded by checking the presense of `../` in the decoded path, but on Windows, `..\` works.
Code: https://github.com/firebase/superstatic/blob/v5.0.1/lib/providers/fs.js#L71

## Steps To Reproduce:

Install and run superstatic (`npx superstatic` in any dir). It could be also used as a Node.js lib.

Go to `http://localhost:3474/..%5c..%5c..%5c/Windows/notepad.exe` (adjust the path accordingly, that's for `C:\Users\User\tmp`).

*Note: don't use Edge for that, it decodes the path itself. Use e.g. Chromium.*

## Supporting Material/References:

- OS: Windows 10
- Node.js v8.9.4
- npm v5.6.0
- Chromium

# Wrap up

- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact
