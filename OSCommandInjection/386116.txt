Hi there,

Step 2 : Now go to on this link and download transaction history. 
Step 3 : Download file as CSV and open it you can =4+4 become 8 so it's prove CSV injection.

Malicious user can take big advantage of this vulnerability because from that vulnerability we can run base OS command on any anonymous user account.

**Prevention**
Strip "=" only, it's not foolproof fix, see this report [#72785](https://hackerone.com/reports/72785) you have to strip +/-/@ and | as well.
