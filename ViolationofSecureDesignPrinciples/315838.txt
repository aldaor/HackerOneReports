Summary:

Hello Security Team,

**Summary:** Like report #255978 It is possible to access origin servers served by nginx and not cloudflare. 

**Description:** Even though these IP's don't serve a functional version of the app it is possible to enable DDoS attacks by bypassing cloudflare protections.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. 52.32.239.55
  2. 54.69.218.2
  3. 34.208.41.101
 
There are more IP's but I think these are enough as a proof of concept.

## Impact

Response header from one of origin IP's :
`Connection:keep-alive
Content-Encoding:gzip
Content-Length:4774
Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8

and the regular website:

Also http://54.69.218.2/login serves an insecure login page.
