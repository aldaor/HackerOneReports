Summary:

There is a host header poisoning vulnerability on gratipay.com that allows an attacker to cause a 301 redirect and poison the browser DNS cache to cause all further requests to gratipay.com to be redirected to the attacker's site.

PoC Request:
```
GET https://gratipay.com/ HTTP/1.1

Things to note:
1. Tested on Firefox, Host header manipulated with the Live HTTP Headers and Tamper Data addons
2. The attacker must create a malicious Heroku app to redirect to, in the PoC i have just chosen heroku.com
