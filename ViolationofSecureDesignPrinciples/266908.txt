Summary:

## Summary
A link on `https://about.gitlab.com/resellers/` was broken and could've allowed a user to impersonate a reseller and attack / scam your customers.

## Proof of Concept
1.) Visit https://about.gitlab.com/resellers/
2.) Hit `Ctrl+F` and find "intenso"
 {F219301}
3.) Now click the Facebook link and you'll see the Facebook page I've "hijacked"
(https://www.facebook.com/InTENSO.IT.Enterprise.Solutions)

This happened because this reseller either deleted their Facebook page or changed their username. Not much you could do about that, but I thought I'd report it because it could be used to attack / scam your customers.

Sorry for the lower quality of this report, but decided to report it as it could actually be used to scam users.
Thanks,
