Summary:

## Intro

First things first, so... Crayons, crayons everywhere :)


__Type of issue__: Core CMS issue
__Level of severity__: Internal Attack Vector 
__Concrete5 version__: 8.1.0

## Summary

There is Stored XSS vulnerability in __Name__ field (SEO dialog) for pages. Malicious user is able to prepare payload which is then executed in SEO dialog and on Page Search (index.php/dashboard/sitemap/search).

## Steps to reproduce

- login into Concrete5 instance
- go to Dashboard -> Full Sitemap
- on Pages list, select one and click. Popup with options will show up

{F186242}

- select __SEO__ option. SEO dialog will show up on the screen

{F186244}

- in ```Name``` field, put following payload, right after Page name:

```
" onmouseover="alert('Stored XSS in SEO Name field')"
```

- click ```Save changes```

Now, there are two places, where injected payload is retrieved from database and executed:

- SEO dialog box, when user mouse-over ```Name``` field
- Page Search, when user mouse-over infected Page name:

{F186245}

{F186246}

In first execution (SEO dialog), it is possible to inject payload which will execute __without any user interaction__:

```
" onfocus="alert('Stored XSS in SEO Name field')"  autofocus="true"
```

(__Warning__: injecting this payload will cause XSS execution every time when SEO dialog for infected page will appear on screen. It blocks any possibility to edit ```Name``` and reverts changes)


## Technical details

This vulnerability exists, because there is not enough sanitization of ```cName``` property read from request ```$_POST```,and then use in ```update()``` method in ```Page``` class (concrete5-8.1.0/concrete/src/Page/Page.php, line 1882 - some fragments of code are removed, I've left only ```cName``` processing here, I'm pretty sure you know source code well enough to get the point):

```PHP
public function update($data)
    {
        (...)

        $cName = $this->getCollectionName();
        
        (...)

        if (isset($data['cName'])) {
            $cName = $data['cName'];
        }
        
        (...)
        $txt = Core::make('helper/text');
        $isHomePage = $this->isHomePage();
        
        (...)
        $cName = $txt->sanitize($cName);    // line 1950

        if ($this->isGeneratedCollection()) {
            if (isset($data['cFilename'])) {
                $cFilename = $data['cFilename'];
            }
            // we only update a subset
            $v = [$cName, $cHandle, $cDescription, $cDatePublic, $cvID, $this->cID];
            $q = 'update CollectionVersions set cvName = ?, cvHandle = ?, cvDescription = ?, cvDatePublic = ? where cvID = ? and cID = ?';
            $r = $db->prepare($q);
            $r->execute($v);
        } else {

        (...)
```

In line 1950, method ```sanitize()``` from ```Text``` class is called (concrete5-8.1.0/concrete/src/Utility/Service/Text.php)

```PHP
public function sanitize($string, $max_length = 0, $allowed = '')
    {
        $text = trim(strip_tags($string, $allowed));            // line 97
        if ($max_length > 0) {
            if (function_exists('mb_substr')) {
                $text = mb_substr($text, 0, $max_length, APP_CHARSET);
            } else {
                $text = substr($text, 0, $max_length);
            }
        }
        if ($text == null) {
            return ""; // we need to explicitly return a string otherwise some DB functions might insert this as a ZERO.
        }

        return $text;
    }

```

In line 97, ```strip_tags()``` method is called, which prevents ```cName``` from being infected by HTML tags, like ```<script>```, however it does not protect against presented attack vector, where HTML attribute is injected, with inline JavaScript event handler.

```
string strip_tags ( string $str [, string $allowable_tags ] )

This function tries to return a string with all NULL bytes, HTML and PHP tags stripped from a given str. It uses the same tag stripping state machine as the fgetss() function.
```

Webiste itself is protected well, and XSS payload is not executed (printed ```cName``` is sanitized correctly):

{F186243}

## Testing environment

System:
- Concrete5 version 8.1.0, installed localy
- PHP ver. 5.6.30
- Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 for macOS
- MySQL ver. 5.7.13 for macOS

This vulnerability was tested on macOS Sierra 10.12.5 with following browsers:

- Chrome 58
- Chromium build 60.0.3104.0
- Safari 10.1.1

__XSS Auditor__ build in WebKit/Blink based browsers __does not prevent__ against this injection. I am pretty sure this vulnerability will work in any browser, in any version including the newest ones.



## Impact

Although this attack vector is internal only (```Name``` attribute is sanitized when displayed on page while browsing the website), there is still possible for malicious user with eg. lower privileges, to inject such payload and trick other user(s) with higher privileges (like site admin) to open infected SEO dialog or Page Search, which will execute payload in such user context. I assume here that Concrete5 CMS is used to build website, where many users have permissions to add or edit content.


## Wrap up

I hope my report will help keep Concrete5 safe in the future.
