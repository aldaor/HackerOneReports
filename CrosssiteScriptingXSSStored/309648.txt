Summary:

Hi Guys,

**simplehttpserver** allows to embed HTML in file names, which (in certain conditions) might lead to execute malicious JavaScript.

**Module:** 

'simpehttpserver' is simple imitiation of python's SimpleHTTPServer and intended for testing, development and debugging purposes

https://www.npmjs.com/package/simpehttpserver

**Description**

This issue is another example of lack of output sanitization. 
Here's source code, which allows to embed HTML in file name and run attack presented in PoC section (./node_modules/simplehttpserver/simplehttpserver.js, lines 106-117):


```javascript

    // Check for each file if it's a directory or a file
    var q = async.queue(function(item, cb) {
        fs.stat(path.join(pathname, item), function(err, stat) {
           if ( !stat ) cb();
           if ( stat.isDirectory() ) {
               ulist.push('<li><a href="'+item+'/">'+item+'/</a></li>')
           } else {
               ulist.push('<li><a href="'+item+'">'+item+'</a></li>')
           }
            cb();
        });
    }, 4);
```

As you can see, ```item``` is output directly into HTML without any sanitization.

## PoC - Steps To Reproduce:

In the directory which will be served via ```simple-server```, create file with following name:

```
javascript:alert('You are pwned!')
```

Run ```simplehttpserver``` in directory with file with changed filename:

```
$ ./node_modules/simplehttpserver/cli.js
Listening 0.0.0.0:8000 web root dir /Users/bl4de/playground/node_bugbounty_playground
```

and open ```http://127.0.0.1:8000``` in the browser.

Try to open file with name ```javascript:alert('You are pwned!')``` by clicking it.

## Impact:

This vulnerability can be used to eg. download malware via "drive-by-download" attacks. Also, as described in other modules I've reported similar vulnerabilty, an iframe with malicious JS file loaded from external resource can be executed.
