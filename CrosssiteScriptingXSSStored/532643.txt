## Impact

An attacker who exploits a cross-site scripting vulnerability is typically able to:

1) Impersonate or masquerade as the victim user.
2) Carry out any action that the user is able to perform.
3) Read any data that the user is able to access.
4) Capture the user's login credentials.
5) Perform virtual defacement of the web site.
6) Inject trojan functionality into the web site.
