Summary:

The user description is vulnerable to a Stored XSS via an attribute injection. At fault is the `wp_targeted_link_rel()` filter that parses attributes regardless of their position.

```
function wp_targeted_link_rel( $text ) {
	// Don't run (more expensive) regex if no links with targets.
	if ( stripos( $text, 'target' ) !== false && stripos( $text, '<a ' ) !== false ) {
		$text = preg_replace_callback( '|<a\s([^>]*target\s*=[^>]*)>|i', 'wp_targeted_link_rel_callback', $text );
	}
```

It essentially just parses the attribute string of all `<a>` tags and passes them to the preg replace callback.

```
function wp_targeted_link_rel_callback( $matches ) {
	$link_html = $matches[1];
	$rel_match = array();
...
// Value with delimiters, spaces around are optional.
	$attr_regex = '|rel\s*=\s*?(\\\\{0,1}["\'])(.*?)\\1|i';
	preg_match( $attr_regex, $link_html, $rel_match );

	if ( empty( $rel_match[0] ) ) {
		// No delimiters, try with a single value and spaces, because `rel =  va"lue` is totally fine...
		$attr_regex = '|rel\s*=(\s*)([^\s]*)|i';
		preg_match( $attr_regex, $link_html, $rel_match );
	}
```

As can be seen it then uses a regex to parse the `rel` attribute, its value and its delimeter from the string.

If the rel attribute is found, the following happens:

```

	if ( ! empty( $rel_match[0] ) ) {
		$parts     = preg_split( '|\s+|', strtolower( $rel_match[2] ) );
		$parts     = array_map( 'esc_attr', $parts );
		$needed    = explode( ' ', $rel );
		$parts     = array_unique( array_merge( $parts, $needed ) );
		$delimiter = trim( $rel_match[1] ) ? $rel_match[1] : '"';
		$rel       = 'rel=' . $delimiter . trim( implode( ' ', $parts ) ) . $delimiter;
		$link_html = str_replace( $rel_match[0], $rel, $link_html );
```

As you can see the value of the `rel` attribute is splitted by whitespaces and each part is then escaped. The targeted `rel` value is then added to the alread existing ones and put back together.

Most importantly, are the following line:

```
		$delimiter = trim( $rel_match[1] ) ? $rel_match[1] : '"';
		$rel       = 'rel=' . $delimiter . trim( implode( ' ', $parts ) ) . $delimiter;
		$link_html = str_replace( $rel_match[0], $rel, $link_html );
```
if the delimeter is empty (e.g. when `rel=abc` has no quotes), the delimer becomes  `"`. The original rel attribute is then replaced with the new one. 

This is a problem since the following payload:

`<a title="  target='xyz'  rel=abc ">PoC</a>`

would turn into

`<a title=" target='xyz' rel="abc" ">PoC</a>` Note that an additional `"` has been injected and the title attribute has been escaped.

This is because the regex to match the rel attribute ignores the position of the `rel` attribute within the attribute string. The above payload shows how the rel attribute is placed within a double quoted attribute. Since no delimeter is set, the delimer becomes a double quote and when the rel attribute is inserted back into the string, the double quote is injected.

I recommend using something like `parse_shortcode_atts()` as in `wp_rel_nofollow()` to prevent this from happening.

By abusing the attribute injection, it is easily possible to create a Stored XSS payload. 

Tge `wp_targeted_link_rel()` filter is not only called on the user description, however, this is where it becomes exploitable. This is because this vulnerable filter is added before the `kses` filters are added, which means that the injected attribute would be caught by `wp_post_kses()`. The user description is the only exception where the kses filters are called before `wp_targeted_link_rel()` is called.

`<a href="#" title=" target='abc' rel= onmouseover=alert(/XSS/) ">This is a PoC for a Stored XSS</a>`


## Proof of Concept

The following will demonstrate how a normal forum user can achieve stored XSS on their profile page in BuddyPress
████████

1. This works if the Bio of forum users is displayed in their profile page. Log in as an administrator and go to Appearence -> Customize and then BuddyPress Nouveu -> Member front page and make sure that displaying the user bio is enabled

2. Create a normal forum user account
3. Login and edit your profile. Paste 
`<a href="#" title=" target='abc' rel= onmouseover=alert(/XSS/) ">This is a PoC for a Stored XSS</a>` as your user description
4. visit your profil and hover over the link.

## Impact

The Impact of this can vary from site to site. I have shown how this can be exploited in BuddyPress as a mere, normal forum user. Since you can also inject a style attribute and make the link span over the entire page, one can turn this into a wormable Stored XSS in BuddyPress.

Basically every plugin or forum is affected that displays the user description.
