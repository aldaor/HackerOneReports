Summary:

Cryptographic protocols like TLS, SSH, IPsec, and OpenVPN commonly use block cipher algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, to encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is encrypted separately according to a mode of operation. Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, whereas AES uses a block size of 128 bits.
A attacker can can decrypt victim data using Sweet32 birthday attck vulnerability over wifi or (local network) 
PoC:
1. open nmap and type: nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers demo.weblate.org
2.and wait until it finishes the scan
3. here are the results 
64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack
Key exchange (secp192r1) of lower strength than certificate key
