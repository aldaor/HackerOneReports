Summary:
Information Exposure Through Debug Information
**Summary:** 
Information exposure through /debug in ms5.twitter.com

**Description:** 
Debug page from ms5.twitter.com exposes internal info, such as internal IPs and headers. 

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Visit ms5.twitter.com/debug
  1. See internal IP and header-names used
  1. To gather more internal IPs, just refresh (or script curl requests) and you'll get a new internal IP every time.

## Impact: 
If an attacker gains access to your network, knowledge of internal IPs could help them know where to target.

## Supporting Material/References:

I made a script to make requests to see if internal IPs changed and every time I got a new one. Here is the 20 IPs I found using this technique:
> 10.49.205.118
> 10.45.237.113
> 10.81.156.108
> 10.58.127.114
> 10.58.103.105
> 10.58.217.103
> 10.42.70.113
> 10.45.222.103
> 10.58.101.114
> 10.45.221.103
> 10.45.109.100
> 10.42.70.119
> 10.43.71.127
> 10.48.219.111
> 10.44.90.100
> 10.46.246.111
> 10.43.73.138
> 10.46.6.102
> 10.45.65.104
> 10.45.64.108

## Impact

Debug pages should not be public. Giving away internal IPs means that an attacker could use this info for their advantage and know which IPs to target.
