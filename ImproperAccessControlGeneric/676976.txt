Hi GitLab Security team

### Summary

GitLab makes the container scanning and dependency scanning information available as part of a JSON endpoint for merge requests. These reports are output of the CI job and should only be displayed if the visiting user has access to CI. However, right now GitLab displays the the container scanning and dependency scanning reports regardless of this permission, making it available to whoever has access to the merge request.

For public projects, GitLab allows to restrict CI pipelines to project members only (public pipelines disabled). However, in this case, the merge request widget still renders the scanning reports result, which is the outcome of a CI pipeline.

### Steps to reproduce

This is reproducible on gitlab.com. It requires at least a gold plan to have the container scanning and dependency scanning feature available.

1. Create a public project, restrict CI pipeline access to project members, and disable public pipelines
2. Push a  new branch and add .gitlab-ci.yml file with the following content:

```yml

3. Create a merge request with those changes
4. As an unauthorized user, visit the page `https://example.gitlab.com/<namespace>/<public-project-name>/merge_requests/1/merge_requests/1/container_scanning_reports` and `https://example.gitlab.com/<namespace>/<public-project-name>/merge_requests/1/merge_requests/1/dependency_scanning_reports`

These two endpoints are now leaking the container scanning dependency scanning information to unauthorized users, who do not have access to CI. 

### Impact

Unauthorized users have access to critical information like the container scanning or dependency scanning report, thus have a lot of insight of an application. By knowing the found vulnerabilities (or still existing), they could attack the target application.

### Examples

This happens on gitlab.com. I've setup a test project, where the CI pipeline access is restricted to project members. However, you can access the container scanning and dependency scanning report from CI via the following endpoints:

* https://gitlab.com/test-group-wter/test-reports/merge_requests/1/container_scanning_reports
* https://gitlab.com/test-group-wter/test-reports/merge_requests/1/dependency_scanning_reports

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Container scanning and dependency scanning reports are leaked on merge requests endpoints. 

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Container scanning and dependency scanning report endpoints on merge requests require proper access control to avoid leaking it to unauthorized users.
