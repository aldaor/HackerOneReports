Summary:

Hi team,

### Summary: 
Subdomain `developer.openapi.starbucks.com` is vulnerable to subdomain takeover via Mashery service. The reason why it's worked unfortunately not fully clear to me.

### Details:
Doing my recent research on starbucks.com subdomains, I stumbled upon http://developer.openapi.starbucks.com/ The server returned 200 response with the following {F227581} The `Server` header of HTTP responce was `Mashery Proxy` so it gave me an idea, that I should go and try register an trial account at https://www.mashery.com/

After registering an account and confirming it, I got access to the dashboard. Under the `Portal Settings` menu there was an option to add your own domain name. I added developer.openapi.starbucks.com as my domain and I get no error. After I went to the http://developer.openapi.starbucks.com/ and saw welcome page {F227586} which gave me understanding that I can serve my own content under developer.openapi.starbucks.com

### PoC:
I added simple js code to the Welcome page `alert(document.domain)` for this proof-of-concept.
To confirm it just click this link http://developer.openapi.starbucks.com/

### Impact:
As I can serve my own content without any restrictions, with this webpage I can set up a campaign to steal user cookie sessions, or use it to steal credentials, or for phishing purposes. 

Please let me know, if you need more information!

Thanks,
Danil
