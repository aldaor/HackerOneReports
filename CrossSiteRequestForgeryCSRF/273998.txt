Summary:

SUMMURY
=================
i tested that all post request has CSRF token.
During Author profile creation also a CSRF token is posted. Now when i removed this CSRF token , show   s error like bellow 
```
CSRF validation failed

0 /var/www/csprng/src/Cabin/Bridge/Controller/Author.php(52): Airship\Engine\Controller->post(Object(Airship\Cabin\Bridge\Filter\Author\AuthorFilter))
/var/www/csprng/src/Engine/AutoPilot.php(485): Airship\Cabin\Bridge\Controller\Author->create()
 /var/www/csprng/src/Engine/AutoPilot.php(315): Airship\Engine\AutoPilot->serve(Array, Array)
 /var/www/csprng/src/public/index.php(86): Airship\Engine\AutoPilot->route(Object(Airship\Engine\Networking\HTTP\ServerRequest))
{main}
```
So its a CSRF validation failed error.
Now if request submitted with proper CSRF token, then response will be 302 redirect.
So, i come to this point that if proper CSRF token provided then we get 302 redirect as success response and If CSRF validation failed then we get above error response or something else.

Now  during Blog Reply comment Following request POST data is made
```

_CSRF_TOKEN=KrkFX0bGkcwgoIKX8Y7KKr1F%3A0ElYiUhZ5wJDSS8kE2FmPxY58Dr3533SH63ZRJBPBfO-&author=47&name=&email=&url=&message=ssdfsfsfsf+sfsd&g-recaptcha-response=03AJzQf7Ojuy_9znHGgl-bZOSweJZo...............

```
Now remove the CSRF_TOKEN and see  302 redirect as response header, this  indicate that request is successfull and server does not checked CSRF here And no CSRF validation error.
```
