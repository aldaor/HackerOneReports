Summary:

Description
========

When a new user has been registered, Instacart pops up a message offering the user for a limited time 14 days express trial, in which the user may decide to skip and subscribe later on decision. The research has found that the express trial subscription endpoint does not implement any protection against CSRF attack, the following list possible cases in which the endpoint may needed protection:

- The new user, may decide to skip the subscription and try the free version first for a while, and later (for example, before actual service purchase) try for 14 days express, in this case the attacker force user subscription via CSRF attack.

- The user who was CSRFed may believe that he is using the free version - consuming trial time, and missing the express features.

- The effect of CSRF vulnerability in this endpoint means that new user is subscribe for express trial automatically. Serious attacker may create a phishing site claiming that all new user will get unlimited subscription (by clicking the phishing site subscription button), the attacker may tell user to just ignore the remaining days they see, all the users will believe that because clicking the attacker site does affect they instacart account, plus the site can be trusty (e.g: premiumsecret-instacart.com), the user may provide further personal detail on attacker requests.
