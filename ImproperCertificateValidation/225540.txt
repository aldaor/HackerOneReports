Summary:

Weblate appears to have a public facing git repository located at git.weblate.org that utilises HTTPS when viewed in the browser. (As a side note, netcat to port 80 results in the default debian landing page).

77.78.107.252 - git.weblate.org

The site has an incorrectly configured certificate, and enforcing HSTS means users are unable to connect.

The certificate in place appears to be for avatar.cihar.com. SSLScan confirms the error presented by the browser:

<..snip..>

A curl request with verbose reporting gives a slightly clearer picture:
