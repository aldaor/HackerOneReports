Summary:
The researcher found an XSS vulnerability caused by query parameters not being properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.
## Summary:

PUBG's main website https://www.pubg.com has an endpoint that is vulnerable to an injection vulnerability - namely a reflected injection of JavaScript, also known as Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS). As per OWASP's definition: "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. "
This happens because one of the GET parameters "p" does not properly sanitize/escape user input, allowing an injection to occur.

## Steps To Reproduce:

To reproduce this, an attacker has to:

  * Prepare a Javascript payload that it wants the victim to execute. In this case, for Proof of Concept purposes, our Javascript code will prompt an alert showing the users' cookies.

```javascript
alert(document.cookie);
```

  * Inject this Javascript code properly into the vulnerable parameter, creating thus a crafted future GET request that will inject the payload.

```GETRequest
GET /?p=iqz78'%3e%3cimg%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(document.cookie)%3d1%3echplq HTTP/1.1
Host: www.pubg.com
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)

```
Request PoC {F651167}


  * As this injection happens in a GET parameter, the attacker simply needs to send the crafted Link that produces this GET request to the victim and have the victim click it.

## Impact

With user interaction, an attacker could execute arbitrary Javascript code in a victim's browser.
This would allow an attacker to unwillingly make a victim:

* Perform any action in the identified endpoint
* View any information that the user is able to view
* Modify any information that the user is able to modify (not sure if applicable in this case)
* Interact with other application users as if it were him - impersonation (not sure if applicable in this case)
