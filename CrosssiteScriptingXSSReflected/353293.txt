Summary:

Previously this issue was resolved at another location in report #351376
After spending more time searching the website, I found additional areas where this problem persists:

https://sandbox.reverb.com/my/buying/orders?query=
https://sandbox.reverb.com/my/selling/listings?query=
https://sandbox.reverb.com/my/selling/orders?query=

These queries render several html tags along with the class attribute. This allows a user to spoof content and make it appear to come from Reverb.com. 

In this PoC I use several tags along with the class attribute to prompt a user to click an outside link. The message uses Reverb.com CSS branding and appears authentic.

## Impact

An attacker can create a link on behalf of Reverb.com to persuade a logged in user to take a number of different actions like visiting a malicious website to steal account information.
