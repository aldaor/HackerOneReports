Summary:

Hello Semrush Team, 
 In this report id ```311330```, I was filled duplicate and redirection url is fixed which  made me feel happy as deserving bounty hunter gets a reward.

However, after fixing from last night, I finally bypassed the redirection method which not only Triggered Xss, but also it redirects to somewhere else.

```
https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=https://(websitelink)
```

#To reproduce

So,I tried to craft a XSS like ```javascript://%0aalert(document.cookie)``` at the end of redirection Url,so it doesn't work.
Afterwards,I encoded %0a to %250a, then modified the payload and injected at the end of url and it works like a charm.

Here are the XSS payloads
https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=javascript://%250Aalert(document.cookie)
https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=javascript://%250Aalert(document.domain)

When a particular user clicks the button,it's going to triggered an XSS.

Now,Here comes the tricky part regarding Unvalidated redirection-

Now if you inject ```javascript://%250Aalert(document.location="https://google.com",document.location="https://www.facebook.com")``` at the end of url like this 

https://www.semrush.com/redirect?url=javascript://%250Aalert(document.location="https://google.com",document.location="https://www.facebook.com")

and a particular user click go to site,first page will popup google.com and then it's going to redirect to facebook.com.

Please Consider it and let me know.

With Regards
