Summary:

**Summary:** DOM Based XSS (or as it is called in some texts, “type-0 XSS”) is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” in the victim’s browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an “unexpected” manner ([Source](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS))

**Description:** It is observed in https://parcel.grab.com/assets/bower_components/lodash/perf/ endpoint that the value given in ```build``` and ```other``` GET parameters are accessed by client side script and written on page using ```document.write``` without output encoding - resulting DOM XSS. 

Vulnerable client side cod in page:

which will track back to script source - in switch default value has been set to ```build``` which will be same as user injected in parameter.
