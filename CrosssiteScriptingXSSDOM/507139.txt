Summary:

I have found a stored DOM based XSS in the order page at WooCommerce 3.5.6.

The Data input from HTML element name `_shipping_state` and `_billing_state` in order page outputs data without escaping.When the victim read the page containing the payload, it executes the script.

# Steps to reproduce

1. From a Wordpress admin menu, naavigate to WooCommerce page.
2. Click to `Add order` (Or select to the exist order data, navigate to edit page.)
3. Click to pencil icon of  `Billing` or `Shipping` items, and expand input form.
4. Select to  `Select a country...` by Country item.
5. Input following value in State / Country item.

> "><img src=/ onerror="alert(location.host)"

6. Click Create button.(If navigated from the exist order, click update.)
7. Navigate to edit page, after then an alert displayed.

The security impact is the same as any typical XSS.
