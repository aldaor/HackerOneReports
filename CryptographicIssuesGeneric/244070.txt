# Summary
Websites using TLS 1.0 will be considered non-compliant by PCI after 30 June 2018.

# Description
TLS 1.0 has several flaws. An attacker can cause connection failures and they can trigger the use of TLS 1.0 to exploit vulnerabilities like BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS).

# Steps To Reproduce

-Nginx, locate any use of the directive ssl_protocols in the nginx.conf file and remove TLSv1.

ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  
-Configure your web server to disallow using weak ciphers. You need to restart the web server to enable changes.
