Summary:

mongoose

**Observed Behavior:**
When creating a TOTP secret a 16 character base32 encoded string is presented to the user.

**Expected Behavior:**
I would expect a 32 character base32 secret to be presented.
The RFC recommends 160 bits of entropy, which is 32 character x 5 bits per character in a base32 string.
RFC 4226 Section 4 Requirement 6 -  128 bit minimum, 160 recommended.

**Reproduction Steps:**
Request a second factor for a user authenticated  with username and password, count the characters presented. It should be 32 not 16.

Problematic code is 
src/applications/auth/factor/PhabricatorTOTPAuthFactor.php:   
 return strtoupper(Filesystem::readRandomCharacters(16));

readRandomCharacters from phutils returns a random string using base32 characters.

## Impact

I have rated this a no impact, however I am not a cryptographer, and it is a clear violation of a cryptographic minimum key length requirement in a published RFC. Quantum supremacy may also be relevant here.
