Summary:

Description

Companies like Twiter,Facebook and even Hackerone implemented a strict email security policy (combining SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) but I don't see that from gratipay You should apply strict SMPT policy to stop spoofed email sending from your domain. POC is attached.

Exploit scenario:

An attacker would send a Fake email from security@gratipay.com saying that Please change your password, The victim is aware of phishing attacks, But when he sees that the mail originated from security@gratipay.com , He has no other way than to believe it. Clicking on the link takes him to a website where certain JavaScript is executed which steals his gratipay.com id and password (SESSION COOKIE). The results can be more dangerous.

Code to Exploit:

<?php
$to = "VICTIM@example.com";
$subject = "Password Change";
$txt = "Change your password by visiting here - [VIRUS LINK HERE]l";
$headers = "From: security@agratipay.com";
mail($to,$subject,$txt,$headers);
?>
You should do the fix (see the fix below) To prevent misunderstanding and to protect your users.

FIX

Replace ~all with -all to prevent fake email.
