Summary:

Dear Gratipay bug bounty team,

# Summary
---

Gratipay currently uses the [random](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/random.html) module's pseudo-random number generator which is not a cryptographically secure PRNG as stated in the docs:

> The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.

The PRNG is implemented in `crypto.py` as follows:

~~~
try:                                # use the system PRNG if possible
    random = random.SystemRandom()
    using_sysrandom = True
except NotImplementedError:         # fall back
    import warnings
    warnings.warn('A secure pseudo-random number generator is not available '
                  'on your system. Falling back to Mersenne Twister.')
    using_sysrandom = False
~~~

# Why does this vulnerability exist?
---

A PRNG is an algorithm used to produce random-looking numbers with certain desirable statistical properties. In order for a PRNG to be cryptographically secure it must be resistant to prediction.

The random module uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) by default, which is designed for simulation (Monte-Carlo simulation) and modelling, and is therefore not suitable for cryptographic purposes. Interestingly Gratipay's current fallback from the `random` module is in fact the Mersenne Twister:

~~~
 warnings.warn('A secure pseudo-random number generator is not available '
                  'on your system. Falling back to Mersenne Twister.')
~~~

# How can this be fixed?
---

I recommend using the [secrets](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/secrets.html#secrets.SystemRandom) module's PRNG as follows:

~~~
random = secrets.SystemRandom()
~~~
