Summary
========
During my reconnaissance for your bug bounty program, I discovered an instance of nginx version 1.4.6 running at the IP address https://54.153.101.52. To locate it, I search for IRCCloud-related certificated and found the self-signed certificate for this server (https://censys.io/ipv4/54.153.101.52). This version is in the range of nginx versions affected by the CVE, [CVE-2014-0133](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0133). There is a known exploit for this CVE. According to MITRE, this "heap-based buffer overflow in the SPDY implementation in nginx 1.3.15 before 1.4.7 and 1.5.x before 1.5.12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request."

{F120380}

However, to succeed, I believe that the exploit requires the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default) and it requires no --with-debug configure option, if the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive is used in a configuration file. Because I am unable to check the configuration of your server, I wanted to inform you of this outdated version.

Checking for Vulnerability Steps
========
1. Log into server located at 54.153.101.52
2. Check the nginx configuration file. This should provide you with information as to whether or not it is vulnerable.

Mitigation
========
Regardless, this is a very outdated version of nginx that should likely be updated to the most recent version if you intend to keep if publicly-exposed. This would correct the vulnerability (if it is vulnerable). Alternatively, if you only want to correct the vulnerability, you can use the patch below:

```
