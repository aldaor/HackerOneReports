Summary:

Hello Yelp,
Old unused Password reset tokens are not expiring on yelp.com after the issuance of a new token.

EXPLANATION:

Suppose at 09:00 hrs I used password reset options of yelp and got a token on my email.Lets call it token_01. But i did not use it.
And at 09:04 hrs I used again the password reset option and got a new token,which is token_02.
Now generally after the issuance of token_02,the previous unused token should expire.But in case of yelp its not happening.Both the tokens are remaining usable at the same time.

ATTACK SCENARIO:

Suppose I am an attacker and I got access to the recovery email option of your yelp account.I logged in to your recovery email (suppose that is user@gmail.com).Then I used the forget password option of your yelp email.I will get one password reset token.
I noted the token and then deleted the email from user@gmail.com.
In the meantime you understood that someone got access to your gmail account.Then you reset the password of your user@gmail.com so that any one cant hack again your yelp account.
Now its time for my exploitation.
I will use my token which is live even after your issuance of new token.and I will hack into your yelp account.

MITIGATION:

All password reset tokens should automatically expire after the issuance of new ones.
