Summary:

Hello,

## Issue descripton
your incoming SMTP servers, provided by google , seems to be accepting without authentication mails from addresses `@paragonie.com` and destined for addresses `@paragonie.com`.

This can greatly ease spear-phishing attacks, as users usually put much trust into emails coming from their own domain name, let alone people they actually know.
For instance, an attacker could craft an email impersonating your CEO or your IT dept. and asking to open a malicious link or attachment, then send it to some of your users by leveraging this vulnerabilty.

## Issue reproduction
using the sendemail script (http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail/) :
`sendemail -s alt1.aspmx.l.google.com:25 -o message-file=mail2.txt -t security@paragonie.com -f scott@paragonie.com -u "security testing of mail relay" -vvv`

If you will, I can also reproduce the issue at your request, with any "from:" and "to:" addresses that you like.

## Trace output
As this trace shows, I was able to send an email from scott@paragonie.com to security@paragonie.com, without authentication.

## Recommendation
Authentication shall be requested for incoming emails from internal `@paragonie.com` email addresses, especially when they come from untrusted networks such as Internet.
