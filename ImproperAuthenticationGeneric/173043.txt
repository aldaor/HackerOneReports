Summary: [First_Issue]
====================
According to This note in `Download My Data` Page 
`Note: There is a limit to the number of times per day you can download your data. ` and when the user do more than 2 requests Per day another massage appear saying `" You've requested your data the maximum number of times today.

Steps To Produce[Second_Issue][Text_vresion]
====================
1- The Attacker will use the same POST Method that already saved in the repeater / Used in Issue one /
```
POST /accounts/unlock HTTP/1.1
Host: accounts.snapchat.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0

xsrf_token=AoaRT596SUeoTsWqXjzNPQvsZko
```
2- The Attacker will change The ` xsrf_token=kB5hC3JiO-au9yaO83iOTMqCvM4` & `cookie` But How he will get the New xsrf_token of the session ? Simply By logging in to his account then Browse to https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/unlock and turn on intercept then click The "Unblock" Button. Now the New cookie and the xsrf_token Will show up in the request Like This :

```
POST /accounts/unlock HTTP/1.1

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
