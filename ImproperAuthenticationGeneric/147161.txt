Summary:

#####Issue
The consultant identified that there is an unauthenticated installation of apache tomcat installed on the affected host. This particular installation has the /examples directory exposed which contains several scripts that execute server side code, these scripts can also be leveraged to carry out other attacks.

----------
#####Affected URLs
    https://oneclickdrsfdc-test.informatica.com/examples/servlets/index.html
    https://oneclickdrsfdc-test.informatica.com/examples/jsp/index.html

####Risk: **Medium**
This issue has been marked as medium due to the amount of executable scripts that are available in both the jsp and servlets directories.  Both of which can lead to:

 1. Significant Source Code Disclosure
 2. Significant Information Disclosure

#####Remediaton
Implement http authentication on the affected directories, or alternatively  remove the examples folder entirely to prevent the attack surface.  Consider following a lockdown procedure against the installation and updating Tomcat to a newer instance.
