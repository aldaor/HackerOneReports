Summary:

Steps to reproduce:

0. Install and set up Nextcloud, (optional: create a few random users)

1. Apply the following patch to a standard Nextcloud server:

```patch
diff --git a/settings/BackgroundJobs/VerifyUserData.php b/settings/BackgroundJobs/VerifyUserData.php
index 56ebadff9c..76ed8b5ed3 100644
--- a/settings/BackgroundJobs/VerifyUserData.php

		$lookupServerData = $this->queryLookupServer($cloudId);

		// for some reasons we couldn't read any data from the lookup server, try again later
		if (empty($lookupServerData)) {

```

2. Run the Nextcloud cronjob from CLI:

```sh
$ sudo -u www-data php -f /path/to/nextcloud/cron.php
```

3. Get an output similar to this (indicating that user names for every
user and the Nextcloud domain is leaked to the lookup server):

```
Lookup server response for cloudId=admin@pferdeapfel.intranet.struktur.de:8096: Array
(
)

Lookup server response for cloudId=leaked@pferdeapfel.intranet.struktur.de:8096: Array
(
)
```

There's absolutely no reason to leak such information. (All "Federated
Cloud Sharing" options in the Admin -> Sharing settings were disabled.)

This is especially bad as we have https://hackerone.com/bugs?report_id=508487

## Impact

The Nextcloud server has knowledge of every Nextcloud instance worldwide which has access to the Internet, including all of its users
