## Report Summary

During our analysis and reconnaissance of how Ed program worked during the h1-702 event, we realized there was a critical flaw on how the program was setup. 

## Report Description

During the process, we realized that the program manager had tendency to leave secrets open in the wild. While analyzing this, we decided to look into hardware hacking. So as we looked around, we found that the owner of the program left their computer open. What was worse is that it allowed us to to use this to exploit this and get root access into multiple services.

Access to internal documentations, Ed program statistics and internal details.
